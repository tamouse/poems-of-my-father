title: "The Blaze"
---

The blaze reminded no one of bonfire,
bon is French for good, this is not good;
meant to destroy, sent to bring fear, entire
blocks of cities burn, not only wood,
the very paint, the plastic forms melt, spark
more flames.  How much pain in the awful dark
of panicked night can a raging fire cause?

What do nerves do? Draw back like kitten claws,
go unconscious, faint away?
