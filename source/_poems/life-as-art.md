title: "Life as Art"
---

to make of life an art
a voyage as by boat
a worthy wave-bashed craft
held together by design
not afraid to enter
to go now slow now fast

as life itself demands -- go far
go slow, adjustment is the art
of how to come and go.. to enter
as the powers of design
a bold and built together craft

attempting art.. achieving craft
a slow approach departing fast
get out by knowledgeable design
is art
knowing the waters and the boat
knowing when it is time to enter
