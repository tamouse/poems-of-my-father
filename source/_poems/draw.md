title: "Draw"
---

to draw a line where there has been no line
and such a line as clears a telling space
to make a song where there has been but sound

and such a song as reaches through the mind
to write some words with meaning out of sleep
with such a swelling thought that feelings trace

all words from other words their meanings build
let what we draw or write find solid base
let songs re-echo what will not be stilled

this is a task a person well may keep
so let us read and pass the book around
so let us sing and listen to such grace

as charms the air and comforts those who weep
as treasures care and lights a smiling face
