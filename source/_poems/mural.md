title: "Mural"
---


this letter is a mural
runs along the wall
across the window
right on the glass
write on

one long line
now and then
it runs off sidelines
sidebars
shaped  locutions
of nonsense
and misguided sagacity

forgets itself
and runs up
to the ceiling
falls to the floor
trundles along
out the door
up on the wall again
out in the hallway
leading to the elevator

close the door
don't let it get out
into the lobby downstairs
nothing to stop it with
no way to clean it up

now down the street
correctible conclusions
on the curbs of humanity

who now will overcome
this spread of the letter
that is a mural;
will it discover the mountain

and then the valley

how did it get started
this inexhaustible supply
of ink and words
inside a small brush
to swish and slide
on all the surfaces
of the world
