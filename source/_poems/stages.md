title: "Stages"

Imagine stepping through one door
and then another each one leads
to one more grandiose room
until you reach a single place so large
that you are lost
so lost you cannot stay there, not return

so many forces work preventing your return
no way to find the door
definitely lost
Path and hedge-side nothng  leads
away--forever to remain at large
what  blessing that the whole world is your room

at last you find your way into a room
one season smaller now you can return
to find again what seems no longer large
follow footsteps anything door afer door
to rooms with gardens one step leads
into a space to  keep you..unlost.
