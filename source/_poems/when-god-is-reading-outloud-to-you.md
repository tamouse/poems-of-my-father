title: "When God is Reading Outloud To You"
---

When God is reading outloud to you
the voice may be any voice
but always absolutely in control
of its own timbre
it's own tenor
it's own timng
unless
the story grows into a frumpy animal alive
crawlign byitself  to denouemen
then evneGod is not predictable
then even god gets excited
the voice  trembles
excitement rises
for the cimbing sequence
the voice falters
changes from one voice to another
Not knowing what the pitch should be
the power of delving
the patience for the characters
to talk on quietly talking
knowing all along that the voice
that longs for recognition
needs only to wait
to keep on growing
but to hear again
to mouth the very words
so many times repeated
but each time

getting the words better
fixing up the sound
letting the phrasing become more natural
easier
and make the words with you own mouth
of suffereing of coubt
of slowly clearing ingorance
knowing beter all along but required
by circumtance
to strugle phase to new phase
light spot to simple eye
touch recoil to loving hugs
to live again the bbarely beginning
stretch toward daylight
over and over relive
the warning call
because the wondering question
when God is talking outloud to you
every time
it begins again
and every time
the process gets finer
but slower and the pains and pleasures multiply

When God is reading to you
in the birthing pain
of new reaches
in the bandage lifting pain
of new discovery
laying open new layers of knowing
the sheer silent screech
becoming bright and soothing
courage self molded from despair
Going on again into the next chapter
aches and hurts not understood
deep throbs awakening to feelings
sentiments
each repetition
everything is shorter crisper
more aware.
