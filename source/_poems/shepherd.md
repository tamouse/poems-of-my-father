title: "Shedherd"
---

He counts and one is missing,
		leaves the ninety-nine.
He trusts the congregation of the village flock.
  He sees the stray above him on the rising ground.
As he proceeds with courage stronger
		than the sense
of caution  through small scratches, bruises;
he resents his aging loss of strength, climbs up.
A columbine has his attention,
As he falls and scrapes his knee,
he rises brushing sand from broken skin,
a thorn he pulls,
the blood congeals against his garment
torn in falling.
He goes on, finds tansey, textile gold,
low wintergreen, pale purple heads of thistles,
three piled stones someone has used
		to point a way;
an old device he learned before he had grown
	big enough to be alone with sheep...
with sheep... where is the sheep?
Ah, yes, she has come down the slope,
has left the rough and viper-hiding ridges
 			dangerous and steep,
to graze on grasses with the group.
Enchanting thirst directs the man
where springtime seepage paused to make
a small still pool of water

deep enough to take a drink
by muddy flat and moss.
A pod has burst and scattered seeds.
Now small-leafed vines have grown
around the shaded basin where he kneels,
sees high white clouds, inverted brush, himself,
against the sky.
He washes, lies upon the viny quilt. His hand
 rests on a sheet of mica hidden under sand,
a finger-knotted piece of briar,
sharp pink stone, divided from a bed of quartz,
two bits of shell old oceans left
with traces of small animals in hard packed clay,
snake skin, an insect wing,
claw from a passing bear... so many years while
 nothing new has come this way,
now anywhere he looks appears this magic spell.
A bee brings him to hidden honey,
rich in herb and flower scents in thickets
where no steps disturb but his...
is that his name his partner calls and calls...
on tricky slopes he half controls his  stride,
half falls with treasure in his hands,
past the cool-shade stare of cud-relaxing crowd,
down to the village, cries, Look! What I found!
As if some secret would not keep.
What have you found?
His brother's arm upon him lies.
He can not say exactly...
stammers... says... a sheep!
