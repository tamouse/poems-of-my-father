Lemuel looks at his watch.
Oh, lordy, says he.
I m leight.

He jumps up, covers his front
with his jacket and leaves the books on the table.
A library is know playss for forgetting.  No body
yLs at you, get up and go.  It's time.
Not in this lieberry ne way.

So now Lemuel is in the street.
Oh,no, heez gotto go back. He forget
his shoes under the chair. He likes to read
with naked feet.
Will they even let him in now without shoes.
It's getting cold..

There it is
Practiss run number 14.
Im reel-e trying.

He is now running

Thair it is

He gasps as he gets in
the playss is full of angry peeple
Ware  you bin

Oh indeed he is laight

men pick him up
and set him on the stove burners
Tell us Y we shoont turn you on hi

Pretty sune they R all

undr dun egg off plates for thair
leight nite gorgie
Then Lemuel has to take cair
of the cash redge ister
but he is thinking too much
about wot he wus reading
in the lie berry.
That story of the bootiful
opera soprano
who likes to get a weaigh
from it all and go slumming
in jus abowt en wear
who mite turn up
in his verry own playss.

She might bee rite here
inna groop of peeple
weighting to pai

Maybe that luvly won

Dux it taik all nite

snarls, wating to pai
then he smiles and flops
his ten on the cowntrr.
Uther do the saym

with the bewtee in it
Goo'nite the luvly supprano
sez to her frens,
Goo nite, Hortense,
reply the ordinary wons.

Butt Y wud a storrie

Wot a foolish con septic

Hezz aloan now
cleening the playss.

"Taik yr time"
sez a voyss up arrently
in the seeling.
"Wot?"
sez Lemmie,
looking arownd.
He heers it in the seeling
but  no weight is he
going to look up
."Make some fresh cawfie,
ruin a cupple duzn mor eggs,
burn sum mor toast.
No buddy kin dew it laik U."

Lemual tyes his A-prun
bak on.  What the hey
if a voyss tLs him to do
this or that, he kin dew ut.
Sune enough the sounds of
