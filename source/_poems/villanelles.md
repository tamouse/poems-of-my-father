**Introduction to a Long Sequence of Villanelles**

The painter, what parallel unpolared place
did he perceive, yet dare not quite reveal;
 with what senses did that child feel
                    before the artist God-like had erased.

   Did this unheard-from brother want to try
   the powers that make us what we are or seem
to be; the colored flights of old forgotten dreams;
where were the loves he needed standing by?
Into what world of love has he returned
   unfulfilled, all he might be, unlearned?

**I**

How did it happen that we lost the song?
forgot the flesh inside the ghosts we saw?
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

We paid each bill. Each task that came along
We took, we listened, followed every law.
How did it happen that we lost? The song

Goes on -- each measure then was strong
and stronger still with every breath we'd draw
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

We thought the best of living would belong
to us. Indeed, perfection without flaw.
How did it happen?
           That we lost the song

is obvious as we have known so long.
Caresses now revert to skin rubbed raw.
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.
How did it happen that we lost the song?

**II**

**Paperweight**

  When night turned over, it began to snow.
  Still, all your friends knew what to talk about.
  I left a child I thought you'd like. To know

 each other seemed a little way to go.
 Too far to be forgiven, it turned out.
 When night turned over, it began to snow.

The sky changed color, greyed-off orange glow
with darker streaks
		--then you found voice to shout.
I left. A child I thought you'd like to know

came, ready to play and ready to grow.
It was almost as if we'd picked him out.
When night turned over, it began to snow.

A mind gives birth, though no one proves it so.
A figment sharing want, wait, dream, and doubt.
I left a child I thought.
                        You'd like to know

A child -- a flesh and blood child head to toe;
as baby, reader, runner, spender, scout.
When night turned over, it began to snow.
I left a child I thought you'd like to know

**III**

When, after hours, we stayed awake and tried
 with what poor means
		or lack of means we found
 to deal with life: What life? I laughed, you cried

 for you held so much more than I inside.
 We never did meet on an even ground.
 When after hours we stayed awake and tried

to play each other, testing love, defied
what others might consider safe and sound
to deal with live. What life? I laughed. You cried

No more pretense, no more one of us tied
on to the other; both in one death drowned.
When after hours we stayed awake and tried

while all our senses seemed to override
what our own actions made our lives expound
to deal with life, "What life?" I laughed.
                                                 You cried

to deal with life. I took it all in stride.
You were too much to your own values bound
when after hours we stayed awake and tried
to deal with life. "What life?":
		I laughed, you cried.

**IV**

After that I thought about the child
What kind of life he'd have if he were real
and partly civilized but mostly wild.

Not part of our life, hurting and defiled;
with pain that even time seems not to heal.
After that I thought about the child

living on without me. Once I dialed
a number where he might be living. He'll
be partly civilized but mostly wild,

I told myself, a muscled full life, styled
on ax and hammer, sinew, fire and steel.
After that I thought about the child

small in my arms, small in my life, beguiled
and reaching for what living might reveal
partly civilized but mostly wild:

wild like meadows, birds, like seas green-isled,
yet tame to hear what people say they feel.
After that I thought about the child
As partly civilized but mostly wild.


**V**

How we have hoped together, love, for years
When only moments now and then come by.
We have not cared enough. Between our fears

  Of loving and our love, what interferes
  is so much loss which leaves us both to cry:
How we have hoped together, love, for years.

That life we thought we'd found,
		which now appears
had love too long left out, for you and I,
we have not dared enough. Between our fears

of separation and reunion, leers
the monster loneliness. We but but reply
how we have coped together love for years.

Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
Where have our lives gone? No time left to try.
We have not shared enough. Between our fears

Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
We have not shared enough. Between our fears.

**VI**

On nights that I was animal, and you
sang me into human form again,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.

Those many nights my wilder form outgrew
attempts to hold me, none could be my friend.
On nights that I was animal, and you

 into another world in fear withdrew
 with other knowledge without where or when,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.

The storming rage you had to see me through,
my deepest wrath--I was not loving then--
On nights that I was animal.  And you

you had the hardest time, yet somehow knew
to conquer those strange weaknesses of men.
You helped my heart its nobler sense renew.

That I have wronged you, all would say is true,
yet would you sing, my faults you would defend
On nights that I was animal.  And you,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.
