title: "Orange-Eyed Dragon"
---
A girl was coming along
from her house
to the store nearby.
She met a dragon
wreathed in heavy dark smoke.
A small flame sputtered out each ear,
loose scales were falling from its neck.

"What may I get for you?"

The dragon didn't answer.,
but looked tearfully at the human.
The dragon rolled her eyes upward,
the yellow of long-lizard illness
showing around the orange
center of her eyes.

The young female human
decided not to go to the store
but to the sorceress's castle down the street.

(We never hear about this castle
	because no one wants to have to say
	sorceress's.)

She walked up to the two doors,
one very large door
for very important people
and one small door for children.
She knocked at the small door.

An instant whining sound came
from the large door
like a complicated mechanical device
that takes a long time to get ready.

At last the large door opened.
"Please help..."
"Again?" said a red-faced woman
in a ragged dress
with wooden spoons in her pockets
and kettles on her elbows,
"Please come in and take care of the castle.
I'll be back unless the dragon
flies me over the mountain.
Read the books.
Feed the children."

The girl went in and waited.
After having read many books
on how to be a sorceress
and having made thousands of banquets
in the great kitchen
and thousands of breakfasts
in the lesser kitchen

and thousands of picnics
in the garden room
she noticed that the children
did not go off to the village classes
no matter how often
she read to them
no matter how often
they were allowed
to nibble in the herb garden
or dress in old clothes
to clamber through the hedge maze.
No matter how often
they had afternoon tea with biscuits
with butter and honey
or morning exercises in the willow
and tansey goat stream
or wading in the lily and frog pond
no matter how often they were allowed
to take the clocks apart
to ride up and down on the hay lift
they did not go to school.

She noticed an orange-eyed dragon
was drooping its head
in the yardberries.

Just at that moment,
someone knocked at the door.
