title: "Invitation From a Friend"
---

Would you know me?

Then come walking,
hold my elbow,
watch my eyes,
what I look at,
maybe see.

Understand now,
this is tricky,
would you riddle
with a robin?

My own flights
are far more sudden.

When you know
where I will go next,
why the pond to me will matter,
why the stars will wake me coldly,
how the grass will bed me kindly,
how the trees will hold me straighter,
when the rain will clean my body
needing washing smile to footstep,
then we have begun a knowing
for a woodland walk together.
