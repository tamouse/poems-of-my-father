title: "Hook"
---

The dog crept off into the brush to hide
the pain of the fish hook pulling his fur.
He  thought he had been hurt to death,
and death is private for a dog.  When the hook
fell loose the dog had hung his head and slunk
toward to us, crawling low and shameful, back
to where he had to come, fish hook and all.

You left because the words had hurt some place
of secrecy; a pain that seemed like death
and was a death of sorts.  Your coming back
was not in shame but proud, for if we said
some words that hurt, you would not bear the blame
