title: "Streams of Conscious"

Rains storm down
punch the grass

moles and hole dwellers
cower in cold wait

a wash upon the street
stones cluster downhill

somewhere along a valley
ox-bows writhe

somewhere further
beyond perceived dimensions
a wholeness takes in all this pulling and shoving
with a surface calm
