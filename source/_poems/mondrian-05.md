bird at my window
crashing and gone
leaving me nothing
but cracks
across my outside view

one line horizons my space
two others
rising from a conmon point
draw me outward
infinite
a fourth
is a meander
downward

on the ground
the bird struggles
death or long suffering

leaves me
decision
how to be merciful
with this miracle
