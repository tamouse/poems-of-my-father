What they can understand is what he'll be
That's good, they'll say, Another one of those.
He cannot show them what they do not see.

No prophet, only one who started free
but early learned obedience and chose
what they can understand is what he'll be.

For his own vision he will make no plea
as if what others know is all he knows.
He cannot show them what they do not see.

They have some forms with which  they all agree.
Each door to new adventure they will close.
What they can understand is what he'll be.

In his own mind range forms from A to Z.
Beyond the world their public thoughts explore
he cannot show them what they do not see.

They do not want a window or a key
so leaving them in self-induced repose
what they can understand is what he'll be.
He cannot show them what they do not see.
