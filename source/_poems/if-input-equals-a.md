title: "If Input Equals A"
---
I never open my chest
without first looking around
check out the neighborhood
lock all the doors
stuff the chimney
pull down the shades
on the windows of my eyes

Almost a perfect zero
of sensory awareness

then I shout
I am open

I shout
and the glittering flakes
of friendship fall
i shout them up to my waist
my neck
I go on shouting
deeper than anyone's chance
to hear.
