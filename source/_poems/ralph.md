title: "Ralph"
---
We never thought of Ralph as someone dumb.
He couldn't read but hadn't really tried.
He didn't seem to care at all, though some
said he had sat in Johnson's class and cried.

When we played ball,
		Ralph played a far left field.
He couldn't catch a thing, but he would chase
And closer in he'd not keep his eyes peeled,
So he might stop a fast ball with his face.

He'd stand and dream and in the  tightest game
be watching butterflies down in the mud,
stand right on baseline, if a runner came
be looking at a pussywillow bud.

As we grew up and left our homes to go
to school, to work, to bum, we one by one
came proudly back to visit, and to show,
show off our wives, our kids, and all we'd done.

Ralph would be there still watching butterflies
chase dandelion seeds across the field.
We'd yell to him, "Hi Ralph." He'd hear our cries
and turn and raise his hand as if to shield

his eyes from slanting rays although clouds
low might make the day quite dark.
		He'd turn once more
and even when we got up close not know
exactly who it was he'd seen before.

If he put out a hand to touch a cheek
the wondering child of course would turn to run.
How had it become thus, old men would speak
his name, kids run?  When had this way begun?

I said, "Hi, Ralph." He looked into my eyes,
not deep like you, fixed on my glasses rim.
I understood then flowers and butterflies
Weren't beautiful, weren't anything, to him.
