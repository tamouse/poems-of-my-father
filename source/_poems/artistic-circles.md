title: "Artistic Circles"

He painted gray,
dark gray and light,
enjoyed the play
of day and night
through black to white.
He liked the way
the line of sight
refused to stay
in place; a flight
of sheer delight.

He found a clay
he thought he might
by adding, lay
down surprise, slight
but somehow right,
a touch of red
the fighting shade
seemed to have bled
a darker grade
to life and stayed.
	He added blue
almost afraid
as something true
seemed to persuade
the dark to fade.
A middle green

a value new
an earthy sheen
enriched  and grew
past what he knew.
He painted more
than he could plan
beyond the store
of well-taught man.
The color ran,
a million hues,
no limit here,
no need to choose.
The whole true sphere
could now appear.
It is too much,
a self-declared
fantastic touch
of godhead glared
past what he dared.
An emptiness
with no control
may best express
the human soul
in its long role,
yet choose one must
and borders make.
He did not trust,
indeed called fake.
the steps we take.
All his work blended,
what can one say,
his efforts ended
as tray by tray
he painted grey.
