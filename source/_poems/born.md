title: "Born"
---

If I am to be born again
I d like to be the favorite son
of a tribal chief
who owns the overhang
of a cliff where we all live
catch as catch can

except that if I can
order about the others again and again
decide even if one should live
or die for I am the chosen son
of so many sons my father can hang
with any mothers for he is the chief

if I was born again that way my chief
interest would be interviews can
anyone listen enough get the hang
of one person after another listen again
to dream and fear of daughter and son
how they live and wish that they could live

I said before I want to decide if they live
but could not bear the power to be chief
when I said I want to be the son
I meant to include that's all I can
ever be so let me begin again

tribes mostly don't do a cave an overhang
is a safer cleaner better place to live
to carry on and hope to live again
even if not the favored son of the chief
another life and another all one can
or needs to  hope for even a son

or dauhger daughter or son
redo youth dread and  joy rage and hang
around with friends i  hope i can
spend at least one more span to live
to listen son of a chief
if ever i do get to be born again.

rather than ask for heaven with a pillow
and blanket and pudding and leaves
all turning color and falling to lie
for long enough to rot after turning brown
i ll spend my time in gratitude
for that one life i got to have.

I've  had a thousand listeners stay on
while I could write:
perhaps this life of mine
already is a heaven
some poor wretch
has struggled  to deserve
