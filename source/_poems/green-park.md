title: "Green Park"
---

Children are a river flowing out of night
into a park to worship fountains. Soon
they leave life's wishing hours
self-shaping, seven-skilled:
a wave
Through life from life, moving as form does.
The grave
and aging ocean, through half-waking shocks
must ask: is this the soul I had...
Or was?

Butchers of beauty on diets of delight
they play upon green banks, their parents strewn
with sandwiches and grass. They clamor noon,
fast-moving and strong-willed,
a raft
is broken on their rocks.
They laugh
while killing flowers
which die for them
fulfilled.
