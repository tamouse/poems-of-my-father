title: "Grey Wolf"
---

Does the grey wolf state his purpose in his howl
for his companion: "Here we follow.
Something has gone by here, in the night,
something live and full of substance has gone by.
Together we may find it, make it ours."


Does the grey wolf know
that one thing, then another
makes a sequence, takes him to an end
that he can plot and carry out,  repeat.
