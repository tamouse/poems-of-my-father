title: "Family of a Lost Child"
---

We keep the light on hoping his return
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.
a simple opening, our lives so torn
the slamming door, soft voice, "Hi, folks, I'm back."

He was a child we knew could well attract
the troublesome attention, hard to learn
that innocence can meet such dread impact.
we keep the light on, hoping his return

will bring the joyful peace so hard to earn.
His father seems to have his life intact:
few know it is pretense.  His real concern
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.

Too many years already, odds are stacked
against the missing boy.  They tried to warn
us all, that we, in truth, should not expect
a simple opening, our lives so torn,

his mother goes to meetings, her eyes burn
with tears--are all the suspects tracked?
Her project is a stronger way to mourn;
she knows she will not hear:  "Hi, folks, I'm back."
