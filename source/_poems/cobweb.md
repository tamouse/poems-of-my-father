title: "cobweb"
---

A cobweb heavy with the dust
               it filters from the air
disgraceful object, yet nobody sweeps it down,
others like it hide sharp corners of the room.

Under one such cobweb-blanket on the woodbox
beside the seperator, something there?
We lift the web, surprised
to find a souvenir,
a statue we had given him one birthday.

Had he kept it here
to be reminded in the morning
while he took the cream
for income from the milk,
so as he worked the handle
round and round
his eyes could
steady on this prize,
or had he placed
it here and then
forgot that it was here,
or if he saw failed to understand,
did not remember anything
of that story
he had told us many times
		in our believing years.
