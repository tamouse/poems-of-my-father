title: "Princes"

what shall we call her
said the queen
upon her throne
ask the people
and the people
said the queen
upon her throne
  what shall we do
to give honor
she has won
see her children
to live on--her
cherished one--
to make us new

she has two
she has won
to carry on
to be a king
of Britain
she has too
a royal ring
