title: "Princes"
---

what shall we call her <br />
said the queen <br />
upon her throne <br />
ask the people <br />
and the people <br />
said the queen <br />
upon her throne <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;what shall we do <br />
to give honor <br />
she has won <br />
see her children <br />
to live on--her <br />
cherished one-- <br />
to make us new <br />
 <br />
she has two <br />
she has won <br />
to carry on <br />
to be a king <br />
of Britain <br />
she has too <br />
a royal ring <br />
