Make poems as closely as you can
a talk someone rewrote.
Let language sing,
not man.
When Yeats was living he had said these things.

The matching of it all is the surprise
with nothing stretched or cropped.
The fall
and rise
of lines must seem but casually dropped.

Yet Yeats did not pursue
the even line the measured phrase.
We should have that, too.
The words in time
with all the care rewriting thoughts entails.

Most of all he showed
how music swells
so fine
from brief and broken modes
like bells
while slower reading rides and lifts
              the longer line
