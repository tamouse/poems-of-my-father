title: Biking Backwards
footer: "A childhood friend was a paperboy, known for doing this."
---

The paperboy rides backwards on his bike.
Discreetly kindly neighbors play their part
and watch through curtains in this world of tact.
The trick is to pretend there is no trick.

Introspective, retrospective, slick,
the skills confusing simple front and back.
The art is to pretend there is no art
whatever form of craft or skill we pick.

The paperboy will visit at our place
to talk a little of what news he brings.
He pedals off, the smile upon his face
toward me, as if I were at home a king.

He's riding backwards, turns to look ahead,
uncommon skill to see what will have led.
