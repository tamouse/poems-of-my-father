The carcass of the horse we do not bury;
it makes the fading processes go slow.
A log of old
we'll skid him, then forget where he is laid;
so stumble on clean bones next August's shade.
Then Jack will play my Yorick, not so merry.
"Come home, it's almost dark and time to go.
Come home, we do not hide him from the crow.
Come home... it's cold."
