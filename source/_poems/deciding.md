Into my father's woodland I must go
where something waits, old, new, and
			heiroglyphed.
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

Perhaps the way be smooth the movement flow
or I may stumble in obstructing drift:
into my father's woodland I must go.

What good or bad result I do not know,
the message comes as neither choice not gift,
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

If progress falter so the way be slow
or if the paths be marked, the journey swift,
into my father's woodland I must go.

Ambition lets me proudly hope to grow
that others too may find my words a lift.
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

The  wisdom of such choice,
		long years may show
Where black and white by turns
		through branches sift.
Into my father's woodland I must go;
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.
