title: "Hunter's Story"
---

We sat around the fire, we'd hunter grouse.
Skid started talk about a bear but Stub
told him to knock it off, he said to Skid,
Why you don't know  a thing about a bear,
ain't true at all the stories about bear,
real master of these northern woods is wolf.

We talked about another guy we'd known,
had been with us a little off and on,
had got himself in trouble and they tried
him, stuck a needle in him so he died.
Why, that's no way to go, said Judd. Which way
is better? Woods can hold a lot of silence.

Now Stub gets going on this audience.
If I done something real real bad, got caught,
got to the point that they ask me which way
I want to go, well, I'd say wolf.  To die
by wolf, an honor if you have to go.

I wouldn't want it; love too much the plain
and simple life.  What harm it does the wolf--
you think about the other critter, too--
is it a crime for him.  But from that list
of choices: shooting squad, or guillotine,
injection, 'lectric chair, ice floe,
		I choose the wolf.

Quick slash, give him your throat; he knows
the what-for, what to do.  That's better'n dog...
Dogs don't know how to kill, go for the groin,
hamstring.  Bear ain't no killer, hug a guy
to death real slow from sheer stupidity.
A lion even he don't do it right,
he bites down on your face to smother you.
Constrictor snake don't know enough about
what it is doing to you, don't know you.

A wolf will square off,  look you in the eye,
take measure, go in, make it to your throat.
a kind of honor in it. Skid don't like
one word of that at all, says something 'bout
they wouldn't give you any choice, it come
to that.  Stub says to Skid: why, you don't know
'bout woods at all. You should have gone along
with Freddie into town.  Here's how it goes,
if 't has to be.  Sight off the shoreline here;
(This upper lake's a hundred mile of shore,
straight line, and it ain't north and it ain't west.
It makes its own direction, its own world.)

You take a rightline off it, go straight way
into the wild far back 's a day will get
you. First you pass the waterfall--there ain't
no river here but got a fall--they go
to perpendicular two ways at once--
then level swampland,
	moss and trash tree growth,
a forest, trees not good enough to take
for boards, just popple, tamarack, then brush.

Day's end you hunker down against a wall
of toppled tree, the one that took its roots
up with it as it fell, cave for the night
--man ain't done much inventing: this world gives
it first.  You howl a wolf up now and sit.

Stub howls, we hear the forest waiting.
Skid thinks: a sleazy story with an end
to make you jump, and be a fool. He snorts.
This better be a European wolf...
Our native wolves--yes, even timber wolves--
don't kill... none ever has.  So there's your tale.

Stub, he's so far gone in his story, he
don't care: so bring me one right off the Steppes
that's killed before.  This wolf is watching you
as morning shows the smallest bit of light.

He's watched by starlight, now you get to see...
don't know he's there at all till he comes out
looks hard into your eye then circles you,
gets closer, pretty soon he's close enough--
that's his decision--turns and takes you down.

Slash to the throat, he gets the blood out quick.
The blood flows from the brain so you don't know...
for this is his big moment, it's not yours.

So if I had to pick the way to go:
electric chair or drowning, poison cup,
injection, I'd say for that crumb of life
the little bit between man and the world,
when you have got that far, the end, choose wolf.
