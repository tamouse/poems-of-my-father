title: "Key"
---

Found a round key
beside a four-leaf clover
it will open any car trunk
a hundred car trunks

car tools,  bloody clothing,
rotting bags of groceries,
fresh groceries, a dummy,
a corpse, old tires,
water-stained books, emptiness,
holes you see the road through,
boxes full of empty boxes,

I am still looking
for a square key
to turn a spark
lemme burn outa here
find something I want
