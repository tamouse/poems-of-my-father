title: "Mondrian II"

flying has moments
of sheer delight
swoops sweeps
that carry a heart
out of a body

my wings
seemed hardly part of me
diving to soar again
driving against the air

then
a moment of discovery
a squared-off bit of sky

strange double
overlapping world

I drove
that ended it
the crash
the fall
the hurt

all summer sunsets
climaxed
to one break
