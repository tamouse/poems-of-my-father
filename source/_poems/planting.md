title: Planting
---

I live within a garden not my own,
Yet mine to care for, see it grow and feed
My nature as I tend it, flower and weed
The same.  Upon this path I place a foot
To visit cabbages and thistles grown
Precisely here, to know them head and root,
To hear that rain has washed, feel sun has shone.
I walk a nursing ground where I can put
Myself to find a soil for flesh and bone.
