title: "Letter on Old Love"
---

dear lover
know in closing
if you must
in eagerness
or carelessness
consume

our poorest warmth
this open daylight field

of our later years
bares
far too strong a yield
please
take me back
into the smaller room

our first home
dingy
hopeful in its dusk

before we'd grown
our garden
of distrust

no cable car for us
those shaky rides

a slower surer way
to race the tides

feel land-edge tremble
from great ocean swells

along the star-fished beaches
hand in hand

become sea creatures
burrow in wet sand

find driftwood
shining pebbles
and old shells

be eaten
where our giant playmate
hides
