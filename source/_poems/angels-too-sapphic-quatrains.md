title: "Angels, Too: Sapphic Quatrains"
---

Wonderful!. Alive on this hubbub planet!
Sacrilege to waste even single moments.
Yet I do, in idleness, fiddle, lazy,
Waiting for nothing.

Spirit knocking? Genie to ask my blessing?
Me? To bless a spirit? The wrong direction!
Oh, I beg you! Not for mere man to order--
Angels bless humans.

Hell, you say, has rules that are true and perfect.
Satan keeps accounts on the clientel here.
Checking off each day the transgressions, errors,
Adding and adding.

Rules, you say, are Hell on the mind and spirit.
God intended day to be New, Rewakened.
Humans, therefore, can turn to blessing angels,
Changing relations.
