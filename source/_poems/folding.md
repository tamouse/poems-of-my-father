The shepherds are meeting today -- need a meeting -- some bringing water
All day they have traveled, they come from the grasslands  leaving behind them
 Concerns for the safety of animals.
		Now is time that they center.
Though lean tawny lions will feast on the flocks 		in untended pastures;
one sheep for each lion, a dozen perhaps or 			fourteen white victims
from hundreds, no thousands, of sheep on the 		hills and valleys of grasses.

The shepherds are meeting and they will need supper and sleep mats by  nightfall
for this they bring cheeses preserved from the milk of ewes in their keeping.
Green succulents wait for them -- gleaned for them -- over rocks and crevasses.

The shepherds will lie on their cloaks letting one small sunset amaze them
like ages of sunsets as evening calls them,
		calls them away
to dream worlds of landscapes imagined, remembered, clouds of big wonder.

The shepherds will rest and speak softly
		reciting father-told stories
As heroes recount their grand winning with tears 		new tears for their losses --
tell also what foolish things they like young lambs have dumbly committed.

Light laughter will sprinkle the fire time to warm their flame-colored  faces
then coldness of star-smiling sky will remind them wrapped in their skins
to be fresh for the morning return to the normal silence of duty.
