<p>I study
the maple in my yard
with clippers in my hand
Neighbors' trees
have no branches
lower than six feet.
My tree shows no trunk at all.
It is overgrown.
One neighbor calls it "lazy tree."
I could trim it off
to look like others' trees.
The grass is thin
The soil shows black
some weeds are taking root.</p>

<p>			A woman with a buggy
			stops mid-street.
			Her hands reach out
			and out and out
			to hug my tree.</p>

<p>			My tree rests lightly
			on the lawn
			a ball of thirty feet
			ready to bounce
			should one so mighty
			in a need to  play
			come by.</p>
