title: "Taking The Home Apart"
---

first the outer layer
folding the blankets
packing into bales, the poles in pairs
with a short traverse lashed
the bales lashed to the poles
on the blankets a seat arranged
for a grandmother
ties and hooks for piling tools kettles
all  the baskets the wonderful, beautiful baskets
the poles as thiles lashed to horses for the journey...  where can we go
who will give us river prairie
		let us keep our horses
someone lurks along our trail
to take our horses blankets
someone comes to take our prairie
tell us to move on onward is backward
all our trailing is a downward
falling into ruin until in the darkest forest
of our wander waits to take our children
child of radiance who was
grandmother's promise and fulfillment
dance upon her grave
for she is finished and complete
her being now a circle you have rounded
dance upon the ashes of her fires
She leaves you warm
Where is the child who was born
		to sing her name
