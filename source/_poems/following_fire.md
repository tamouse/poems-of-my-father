After the fires, the tourists came
Hoping the camps would be the same
But the trees were gone.  The bear
And deer moved to higher ground. Everywhere
Were the scars of flame.

We'd lost--we thought--what has been ours--
The great pine groves, the cedar towers
where a million people came each year--
Wiped out--whole mountainsides burned clear.
Then came the flowers.
