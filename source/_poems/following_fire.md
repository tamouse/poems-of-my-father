After the fires, the tourists came <br />
Hoping the camps would be the same <br />
But the trees were gone.  The bear <br />
And deer moved to higher ground. Everywhere <br />
Were the scars of flame.

We'd lost--we thought--what has been ours-- <br />
The great pine groves, the cedar towers <br />
where a million people came each year-- <br />
Wiped out--whole mountainsides burned clear. <br />
Then came the flowers.
