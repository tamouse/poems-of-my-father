title: "Misspelled God"

Tree
sways in the wind
leaves laughing
imitation of bright rain
catch light
counterfeit stars

launch into tree
dreadful beauty
harsh bark wrestle
tear at leaves
ripping biting and spitting
stripping
the naked tree
lays cracks
across the sky
bare trunk
hugging
trembling tree
racked on the spinner
scream into unyielding knife blade
unwrapped to the core
torn shreds of skin
fall sighing

pressed great sheets
erect
scenes of galaxies
waiting
patterns of glory
unhidden

naked to terror
branching my bone-bleeding fingers
sink
into these pictures
fade to this panel
the tree
of riven oak
