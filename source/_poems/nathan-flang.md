title: "Nathan Flang - The Necessary Persona"
---


he wrote
he wrote his name a thousand times
he cut the paper into little squares
NATHAN ESQUIRE FLANG , POET
he walked five blocks from home
and then ten blocks
to find the lawn he needed

he said
hi neighbor
here's my calling card
working on your lawn I see
I'm interested: how you control your weeds
I like the way you do your dandelions

do you get help with that
two or three bright yellows over here
a sort of cloud of them there

that must have taken lots of thought and time

the neighbor hasn't anywhere to go
he makes no move
except his trembling  hand
gives  back to Nathan Flang
his calling card
