title: "Deer"
---

When we saw her limping across the meadow,
White tail high, we knew then
		that she was wounded,
Halting as she stumbled, fell down, unflagging
Probably dying

Shoot her, shoot her, that was the thought we
 		shared then.
Hunters all, we knew where to center, focus:
Kill her kindly, quickly; then saw together
Fawn at the field edge

Watching, silent, taught not to bleat or whimper,
Yet a hunger held it. Now who had hunted
Here  (These fields, these woods
were our father's homestead)
Hurting our nature.

When she reached the trees
		for the young one nursing
Even as, while kneeling, she gave her life out,
We could only watch, we could take no action:
Mercy a poor word.
