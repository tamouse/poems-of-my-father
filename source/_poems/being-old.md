title: "Being Old"

To finish this one breath and then one more
As we must work as we have been addressed
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

One dusted sunray columned to the floor
Has strength to hold the sky; so has this quest
To finish this one breath and then one more

The rise and fall of years, of fortunes... or
The rise and fall of breathing: we invest
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

If laughing be too strong to face, so sore,
Without the strength to turn all with a jest
To finish this one breath and then one more

If love seem worn, yet to be loved, we swore
Although it's harder than we could have guessed
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

If life seem faded yet its holds restore
To try our weakness is to judge our best.
To finish this one breath and then one more
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore
