title: "How to See a Rockpile"
---


These stones mark no one's grave--
		here they are piled
as if of no use, plowed up, thrown from fields,
forgotten. But accumulation yields
accomplishment, a direction wild,
unpatterned, not those educated rocks
that are the skin of great cathedrals, spires
to skies, not even cornerstones to shops
When tourists chance  upon them, one inquires,
Then, are these forms of worship or great clocks?
No, just stones left where no one stops.
No Stonehenge, these,
		no dolmen mystery shields
of culture long lost, undisturbed by child
for thousands of generations... A farmer's  mild
reaction to the difficulty of his fields.

See this, a cleavis rusted now that tied
his horse to wagon, this plain broken U
made his work possible,
through little things it came together,

Each horseshoe nail that helped the battle go.
