title: "Father-in-Law"
---

She knew the clock was ticking off alarm
Before they found him in the snow as cold
As January... Eighty-five years old --
Too many years to fret about what harm
He suffered... long retired from the farm
His crops all in, his house and tractor sold,
And all his loving stories told, retold.
For weeks she walked as if he'd need her arm
