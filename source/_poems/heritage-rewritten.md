title: "Heritage Rewritten"
---

Grandma lost all patience over Grampa.
    His nodding off at supper
    His sipping wine
    	cigars
    	cigars with ashes
    	always ashes.
She takes the poems of his pages
    	how the moon
    	had broken off to stars
    	(and others no one read
    	had ever read)
    And throws them in the fire.
Oh, sweet and final vengeance
    	she gives him ashes.
While I with always ashes in my pen
    I do these pages.
