title: "En Espa√±ol"

She stood upon the city square, she knelt
To travel that whole distance on her knees
To demonstrate the piety she felt

The stones were rough, unswept; an unhealed welt
On one knee bled.  To catch a bit of breeze
She stood up.  On the city square she knelt,

Continued on her prayerful way, strong-willed,
Across the pavement, hoping pain would please
To demonstrate the piety she felt.

The ones she loved had been so much at fault--
Grandchildren, nephews--burdens she might  She stood
up on the city square. She knelt,

Two blocks to go. She would absolve their guilt,
Do anything to help--as faith decrees--
To demonstrate the piety she felt.

For this a great cathedral had been built,
One spire three hundred feet above the trees.
She stood upon the Zocalo, she knelt
To demonstrate the piety she felt.
