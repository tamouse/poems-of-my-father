title: "Still Life"
---


Not die, not yet,. Here lying trapped, leg pinned
    beneath a car, no doubt in shock. The sun
    Two hours along in the morning.  I awake

From lying here all night in death-like trance.
    So late. No cars. This must be near the road.
    Went off last night in the dark, but did not roll.
Flung from the car, then pinned by it. Knocked out.
    The night went by, a kind of stupor, held
    a mind left unaware.  Did Mary call?
   She must be worried.  Matt and Brenda gone
To their new home will call her: Mom, Dad home?
    A little worry trembling in the voice.
 --Not yet,  --So late.  Should call the sheriff, Mom.
    If she could call me I could tell her, fine.
    Just fine.  I only have to wait, just luck
    Bad luck that no one has come by. Some kid,
    Or hunter, soon enough, will be along
    In case they really cannot see this wreck

 From cars that race along that winding road.
    Brenda, such a good wife to this son,
Would say again, --Call Mom.  She;'s all alone.
    --So soon? His puzzled son would turn to ask,
But women have a way of knowing when
    A call will be important, though so soon.

--You did so many things I didn't know.
Such tiny flowers and no color there.
In two three months the berries will be ripe
How long can this go on.  The ants will come.
Sweet berries, purple. Ready to be food.
Write down a message. Pen still in the car.
You get it, Mom.  Of course you can't do that.
Try writing with a finger.  Hurts. The stones,
The finger bleeds.  A young queen once, she was
Marie, yes, Antoinette, or was a pin
what she wrote with.  So poke the pencil down
into the ground. Make words. Still in the car.

The berry bush is talking. No two kids,
Are walking by. They look.
		They run,  Hey, kids.
Am I a ghost?  They did not see me here?
Or am I mangled horribly.  They run,
Two little boys not big enough to help?
Too bad it scared them so. They are too small
To pick a car up or cut off a leg.

Matt, time to call your mother, Mom, Dad home?
How do you tell  the age of berry bushes?
  In Matt's old science notebook. Look it up.
  You keep it, Dad, You never throw  stuff out.
    Keep so much junk.

                                  Those animals Elaine
Would make from clay, her tiny fingers knew...
 All by themselves.  The slimey frog Matt caught
And cut up in the kitchen. Clean it up.
This adolescent drawing of the heart.
I'll clean it up, Dad, don't get sore.
Nobody cares in science class, you know.
Nobody cares. No cares go by. Nobody stops.
Don't call so often. Mom has her still life
of pears she's working on. Hello, it's Matt.
I've called again. --So soon.  There's some report.,

--
    Each little detail, painting, phone calls, pears.
    It's not so bad, for  nothing is so hard.
    A stream of warm and  loving consciousness.
    Is dying what this is?  Is this the time?
    A loving voice. A comfortable thought.
    It takes three days at least to die of thirst.
Drink rain. How much can fall?
		My mouth too small.
    Can't catch enough.   It isn't raining here.
    Go crazy, lying, talking to a mom.
    Well, always it's too late or not prepared
    so one way or another... --Son, relax.
    Elaine, you've got to get your homework done.
    Turn off the radio and clean your room.
    Your mother told you that an hour ago.
    How happy she had been on Friday night,
Came home too late from her first date with... who?

--
    A Fred, a Ted?  What kind of dad are you
    That can't remember that young fellow's name.
Bashful when you met him, couldn't talk
then couldn't  stop once baseball was brought up.
    A trickle of fresh blood above the ear.
    Keep moving.  Maybe that's the way to die.
    Not yet.  Oh, no, not yet.  Still life, still hope.
    Until the worms arrive, a conversation.
  Is it dead yet?  No, not yet. More waiting.

A bush nearby. Gooseberries now in bloom.
How do you tell  the age of berry bushes?
How did you know what kind of bush it is?
We always ate them, Mom, when in the woods.
    That was a bad one.  Don't sit up or roll.
    That wave of pain that started from the neck
 Went down the spine and off into each leg.
The car might burn.  How do you die in fire?
 No, Mary, go on painting, don't get up.
    Someone will be along. Wait long enough.
    The berry bush might feed me.
		Snow is falling.
    Cool upon my face. Large lazy flakes.
    It's summer. Can't  be summer. But I feel it.
    The sun is hot and glaring on my face.

    Matt, time to call your mother,
		Mom, Dad home?
    How do you tell  the age of berry bushes?
    In Matt's old science notebook. Look it up.


No facts at all yet, Mom.  We're waiting still.
You have to have the facts to turn it in.

Forget Elaine and Matt, yes, Mary too.
Forget them all now. It has been so long.
How can forgetting hurt so? Can't forget.
Let life go on.  It's their turn now. Let go.
That workshop project though, not done.
		The valance
for the windows in the living room.
What will Elaine do when she's out of school?
The college years will be so great for her.
Those scared kids back again?  The voice.
A father's voice.
		Hey, Dad, where have you been?
--Come stay with me a while, son, work this out.
You kept your scooter, Matt.
		You've learned to type,
 Elaine.  And Brenda's mixing our dessert.
Somebody's mowing hay.  So hope they see us.
New voices. Stomping, Now a mighty scream;
The pain undammed that flows
		like gushing blood.
The metal torn and lifted off the leg.
