title: "At the Art Institute"

imagined worlds
more real than any other
a group child stands beside me
empty-eyed sees nothing

where are those who brought him
something to do on a rainy day
but so careless they have lost him

in the next room
blocks of color wisps of wonder
all this world of warm
to me is cold unmade discovery
as when
I first read poems by Baudelaire
Drooling beside me the group child
has become my brother
mon semblable  mon fr&egrave;re
