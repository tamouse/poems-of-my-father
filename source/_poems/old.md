title: "Old"

i
Let us hope for something old
not this everlasting new
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold

ii
not too much paving where trucks rolled
get rid of bolt and screw
Let us hope for something old

iii
what has been so oft extolled
beauties time has proven true
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold

iv
men on white horses strong and bold
both tough in sinew as in hew
Let us hope for something old

v
stories not too often told
along with forms the ancients drew
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold

vi
books not bound but scrolled
no acid paper, stained with glue
Let us hope for something old
like oak trees, mountains, woven gold
