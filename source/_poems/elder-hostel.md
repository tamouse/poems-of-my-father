Sunset after all day blended light
has hidden gold, strong yellow, orange red
shatters whiteness on the crest of night
hot colors blazing on their own death bed

autumn crowned in universal green
a neutral hiding flashings in the leaves.
consumed to show so lavish but unseen
rich colors day of cooling strength receives

lifetime, sober, dutifully spent
and hiding brightness, now from structure
intoxicated, what had old rules meant
espressions flung, sky falling fires born

the seasoned systems work with age-free prime
true colors that have been there all the time.
