how much I care how much I feel
incarceration. the world would do
no more to me than he is doing now
we stay at home even for each meal
except for Jule I can't ask him to hear
the shame he still goes out
into the world has friends does things
although he can't bring anybody here
concern for my first son
keeps me from murdering turn guilty
as the last hanged man who danced
that fearful step for everyone
so as we joke and watch and drink and fear
each other's feelings and our own
here at the height of my own  life
with all my senses family endeared
that is the choice I make
I tell you it's too much
not to be oneself to give it all
to a damned father for his sake
a problem costs of schools
but over population
here we are so alone
myself, my wife, and Jule
too many kids, almost a crime?
I bless each soul that's born
grandchildren having children

oh I have lived to visit such a time
of course they don't come here or write
you are the first to come by
in over seven years
thanks for coming and goodnight
