And still they gazed and still the wonder
That one small head could carry all he knew	Oliver Goldsmith

The time for line recitals came and he--
Within the context of discussions, talk,
Would quote at length--by couplet, word, or phrase--
Bring in related episodes or thoughts--
An innuendo somehow might connect
To longer passages; poetic moods
Or feelings were as likely as ideas
To string one poem to another, warm
Emotions always overflowing; love
Of line and liner, work as well as worker,
Nobly cited, blessing from the blessed
Upon the meek, the poor, the laborers;
With culminations of compacted joy.

As ever were his thoughts to gladness turned
To ride the waves of love's sad happy times:
A dividend -- through hard years -- he had earned
