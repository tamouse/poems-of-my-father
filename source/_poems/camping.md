title: "Camping"
---

I walk the trail
a furrow-length
into the woods

a birch tree
fourteen thumbs across
at one knee-height
a single touch-me-not
golden under clouds

a popple
the top half
hanging from a stump
my reach
and half my reach again
high
I look closer
it is Balm of Gilead

I brush a fern
a plastic drinking cup

I am one-eighth
of a mile
out of town
