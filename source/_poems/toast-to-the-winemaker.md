title: "Toast to the Winemaker"
---

"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"
lifting his arm as usual, he said;
for many reason, one; to taste the wine.

As usual we answered, timid line,
that hand by which we had in turn been fed
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"

We gathered as we had so many times
with honor to  his table richly spread
for many reasons, one; to taste the wine.

Consumed by his ineriordsign
we knew, he knew this was the last heled
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"

We loved it all, we had no favorite kind:
as we loved him so bowed to his grey headfor many reasons, one; to taste the wine.

Now he is gone (full years, so never mind)
Yet, say, say, say again, not "he is dead"
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"
for many reasons, one; to taste the wine.
