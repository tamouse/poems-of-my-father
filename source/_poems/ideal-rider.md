I'll tell you, ideal reader,
of your future

You walked in me when I was fog and freezing
you stayed when I was glacier-lost but strong
you moved with me
		when I was spring and fountain
when I raged breaking
		maelstromed over cliffsides
you clung,
you clambered through me
inside backwashed caves and courses.
Know then we meander natural but tame
our bedway smoother every turn
past marsh  and grassland...
wait,
the tide-bore churns, new channels are cut out through the blinded delta we will see
before we finish
we respond to moon and sun
