title: "If"

If he had died a cleaner death so those
who followed, who admired, yes, who believed,
even those who worshipped as they grieved,
had left us all a finer way to close
off lives that we in clumsy faiths oppose,
we might learn to have more pity for bereaved
kinfolk, to care that gravestones can be heaved
away as of no weight.
