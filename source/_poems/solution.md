title: "Solution"
---

A sharp stinging flavor,
a cane,
a very large string,
a floor of a ship,
the buried line of a precious metal:

He agonizes over the remaining clues
to the Sunday crossword puzzle.
Suddenly he stands up as the  tart odor
of fresh blueberry pie
reaches his nostrils.
He grabs his walking stick,
swing the honors 'rope'
over his shoulder,
ignors the solitaire deck
strewed behind him,
and begins the grand march,
not feeling the weak spot
in his aorta gives way in the last struggle
of the artery to hold itself together
