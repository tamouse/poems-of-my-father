(version I)

It snowed and snowed
on city park
and street. Hills glowed
through fingered bark,
grays blurred on white.
Our window showed
the longest night
not really dark.

When you were down,
ill, color gone,
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets stamped to stone
we skated on.

(version II)

Because it snowed
in city park
and street--hills glowed
through fingered bark
with grays on white--
our window showed
the longest night
not really dark.

When you were down
strength all but gone
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets packed to stone
we skated on
