Giants live in skies;
they hold each others' hand.
They cannot float at sea
with all its hopes and fears;

they dare not come to land
as firm as that appears:
this world is of a size
for those like you and me.

But each one hundred years--
oh, maybe two or three--
one giant gets to stand
inside one human's eyes.
