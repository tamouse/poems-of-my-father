title: "Last Will"
---

statement and a word that I avoid
a will: strange double word
what I will will not much:
a house: by others more possessed
while I: body and soul employed
a forty-year profession: little incurred:
or now impossible to touch
whoever was the most impressed
the most impressionable among
all takers are the most far-flung
little left behind for me to leave behind
the less to give the more enthralled
the more the value the less to find

statement: with a strange insistence
all that matters must remain
at home but always cropping up exceptions
old papers a box of tools
favorite books for instance
impersonal but with my life's blood stain
who takes in such collections
we follow time-fixed rules
if not betrayed by that assigned
legal legal but uncalled
for  'being of sound mind'
now for a notary three friends
and time for taking care of ends.
