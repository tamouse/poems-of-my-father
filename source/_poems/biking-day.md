title: "Biking Day"
---

One baking day
on  county roads
when bikng was admenture,
we made it to the tower
on the mountain;
walking mostly,
pushing those strong bikes
with new departure coaster brakes
up that painful road
to the lookout tower,

the road mocked now
by cable rides and ski runs
for people nobody knows
to use the mountain
which has for them
the proper conformation:
See Dick Ski

That's how it's gone
for most of us,
conformation
is the use of us
of most of us,
