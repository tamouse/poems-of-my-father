title: "Wordnes"
---

A game of Scrabble takes the afternoon;
That part of it I spend with you, or you
With me: between the bookcase -- finished soon
 -- And watching "As You Like It," channel two.
Such letters, where one drownes, it so enwords
Me. Where to play: the puzzle still remains.
Snowred?  A proper noun? I try ownerds--
That means those weirdos who would play with pain.
I'm taxing even your calm. You forebear,
So I try downers.  You say that's too sad.
Resowned you tell me takes a U.  Such care
To spell; like, "Have I onswered..." That's so bad,
You say.  So Sownder? All these blunders;
Will they never cease, one wonders... Wonders!
