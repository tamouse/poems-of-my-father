title: "Is This How to Peal A Potato"
---

*(see fandango)*


Is this how to peal a potato
with bits flying madly about
juice squirted bits scattered
floor littered walls spattered
the others reply with a shout
this is not how to peal a  potato
with bits flying madly about

then is this how to peal a potato
so slowly so slowly with care
such a thin peeling
one must do this with feeling
but when would we get our share
this is not how to peal a  potato
so slowly so slowly with care

Is this how to fly like an eagle
by running pell mell in the breeze
until cleverly shifting
my weight I'd be lifting
myself off the ground with great ease
this is not how to fly like an eagle
by running pell mell in the breeze
you would crash if you happened to sneeze

say then how can I fly like an eagle
and become quite at home in the clouds
I'd like to be soaring
it never is boring
to be greatly admired by crowds
Oh you never can fly like an eagle
or become quite at home in the clouds

we have shown how to peal a potato
how dumb neckties all really are
we wonder what next
thing will find you perplexed
you really keep going too far

oh one additional favor I'm asking
 is this how to shine like a star?
