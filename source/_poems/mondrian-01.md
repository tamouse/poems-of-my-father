title: "Mondrian I"
---

where has he gone for so long
a new worm colony
a juicier fruit

so long

so he is not coming back
and me alone
with the nest of little ones
fly around all day
pick up
for the family
keep myself going
besides

I might as well fly off
be done with it
one of us at least
would make
a season of it

he was a good provider
faithful
sharp hunter
strong flyer
always a saucy flare
a lot of beak
his way
