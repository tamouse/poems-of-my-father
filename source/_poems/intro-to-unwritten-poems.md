title: "An Introduction to Unwritten Poems"
---

the choice of words is not too difficult
once one decides where sense and symbol lead
whole paragraphs can almost write themselves
as word on word as letter follows letter
to the page. The problem is to find
not which idea patterns a result
but how such effort fills somebody's need.
So many books need trashing, now on shelves
not worth the trouble someone said it better
lines must instruct not idly fill the mind
as well as stand up to those at the loft
the English language, mighty in its powers,
the quick bold stride, the clash, the march to war
the stately force in old iambic embers
that smolder, flare, where epic echoes lie
what each child being read to hears remembers
while ancient sounds resound in his reply
but warm endearing phrase enfolding soft
these loving movements not so much were ours
the Whitman words young poets angle for
to build today a language bravely new
uncounted cadences that find their way
unrhymed but balanced lines exactly tuned
to swallowed screams dark mirrors down a hall
to private tremblings to each household wound
in here we've heard how that is nothing small
that the direction in its work its play
sense intimate, words natural, lives true.
