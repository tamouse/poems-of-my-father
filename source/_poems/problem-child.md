title: "Problem Child"
---


**I**
We watch you walk into the room--sixteen--
somehow the world and you do not connect--
sixteen--afraid, alone, a problem child.
Your father willed to keep his living clean
and raising kids is messy--so, neglect.
The girls were easier--not half so wild,
then all that little league nonsense: compiled
for satisfaction of adults, adult respect.
Why bother.  Let them play sandlot; involved
without the father's time, and more 'correct.'
the mother not much loved, someone between
a servant and a mistress; life revolved
around a tavern; problems left unsolved,
so covered  up; now, you, you make a scene.


**II**
we watch you walk into the room white walled
and you, white robed, to face the mirrored side
The nurse's aides come in with clips and ties
we are the mirror watching you installed
before what is to us a window wide
and open on you private unveiled eyes;
you think you are alone and no surprise
announcement will inform you they have lied
as if enough books were not in your face
they wire you to graphs and charts besides;
we notice one part of your head is bald--
at least they'll read you only, there's no trace
of those dread dawn intrusions which erase
until whole yesterdays die unrecalled

**III**
we watch you walk into the room a pace
or two ahead of orderlies' machines
no one on earth will ever comprehend
how such machines can still be used to place
a judgment or prescription--what it means
is one great mask of numbers they can send
through more machines. Oh, God, I need a friend,
--I meant to say 'you need' not 'I'--these screens
these screams around my and inside your head--
how is it such confusion intervenes?
We need to bathe you in one long embrace--
I mean 'you need'--that came out 'we' instead?
No chances anyway to get things said:
No human touch, just clip and tie and brace.

**IV**
We watch you walk into the room-- a bed--
at least it looks just like a bed--it waits.
They fool us though--they take you to a chair--
at least it looks just like a chair. You're led
to it, you're told to sit, you sit. Two plates
are taped and fixed to you.  You fix a stare
away from us, so anyway you care
enough not to look at yourself. That states
or seems to state... excuse me, you are full
of Pheno Barbitol Silicilate...
a self-betraying serum you've been fed.
so that this session for us won't be dull.
What circuses play within my--your--skull.
How foolish: what it states--cannot be stated.

**V**
we watch you walk into the room. You pull
the robes around yourself, sit down. The staff
arrives, attaches you by clip and wire.
Great rigging for a sail--your head a hull.
Now I can only be to you a photograph,
a three-dimensioned walking 'help-for-hire;'
Our relationship must not aspire,
for others love you.. even though by  half
not realized. ( God no ) to work for more
--think how this world has taught itself to laugh
--is to invite a crash.. ideas gull
and condor in the sky--crash on a shore
where small waves comfort, but the combers roar
to breakers and each minor splash annul.

**VI**
We watch you walk into the room, once more
must we intrude... too much is form, to close
this non-adventure we must finish that.
Think, think, someday we'll meet on some ground floor
with  no deceptive glass to interpose
a lie or lying in, no metal hat.
Imagine, a chance meeting, why we'll chat
completely free, to be where one leaf grows.
No sheets to write on or be boiled clean
'the form will, must be...' what?  no one as yet knows
white walls, white robe, white face, My God, what for?
Think, think ahead to when our right hands touch
in greeting--nothing big--and yet--so much--
the doctor's here--and look, his gown is green.
