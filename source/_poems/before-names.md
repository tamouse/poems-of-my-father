title: "Before Names"
---

once there were  no names
for the earth's
uncountable things
and acknowledging that only a few things
have acquired names
after all these gifted lives piled on determined lives

before anything was named
powers of magic electrified
sinews and roots

none of this separation into classes
categories species platoons genuses
all was one great surge of feeling

a dark stranger shuffled by with tags
cracks appeared in the fleshberg of creation
words put a difference into existence
