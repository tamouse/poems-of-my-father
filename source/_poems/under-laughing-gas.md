title: "Under Laughing Gas"

Closed
closed and locked
brick monuments
together
make a city

Her buddy
don't rattle that door
might set off the alarm

Closed
closed and locked
even the church

Hey buddy
this is half-past one
service is over

Closed
the river cave
blocked by boulders

Her buddy
don't move that stone
someone might get in there

Knoll of pines
opens invites
place to listen

Slope of sumac
hiding black currants
red currants
permits, preovides

Shoe moves
shoe on a kid
hiding in bushes
ashes dropping
through an open shirt

Sneak out here
and burn
burn his nature
burn my nature
chimney it
through lungs

Cluster of monuments
city of locks
chimneys of death
