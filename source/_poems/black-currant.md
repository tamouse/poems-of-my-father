title: "Black Currant"
---

When you first came with currants from the brush
"Casseesse!" you said (I didn't know the word,
knew it was French). I followed you. What stirred
in me came from your press,  you had to crush
the fruit in firm caress and keep the blush
of ripeness of that berry. You conjured
a flight in me with movement of a bird
that sang delights of juices dank and lush.

A private potion it is now, unknown
among the people here. New wine you made
for me, still calling it that foreign name.
We forage this rare fruit with baskets sewn
from swampland grass which crunches where we wade
to take "cassis" with taste we would not tame.
