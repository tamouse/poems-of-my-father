title: "Sarai"

how do stories get so wild
one crazy distortion piled
upon another
I at ninety years
in spite of aging tears
was told yes told
to have a child

grandchild more likely
what to suppose
just to make it readable they chose
to let the ridiculous tale skip
a generation
big male ego trip
what could I do
except to  help him count his toes

hug him as real mother
all the great
male problem solvers of all time and fate
forget the  diapers
or swaddling clothes
perhaps
a warm and learning little one

on loving laps
did those men even think about
our strength her care

as grandma
that's my non historic role
while grampa
his own fake fatherhood extols
sounds off intelligent
on universal ills
like all men
while the women pay the bills
and worlds spin on
to blast their lying souls

of all the old-fool tricks
this fictioned dad
was to believe:
an angel told him that he had
been truly father,
biological oh laugh
so many years since he could raise a staff
I'd scorned him out of bed.

This half grown lad
the grandchild god-child lovely,
raise a hand
against this fairest of our tribe,
yes a command
came into his confuddled brain,
so blurred
so grateful am I that I heard
got dressed in angel clothing
found out where to stand

so just as he was wild enough to stab
this almost man I had to grab
his feeble arm
and in false angel tones
tell him he proved his point
on stones
he fell
and peed upon himself,
a jab

from me
got him backup while Isaac held
him...
let him think he had excelled

you've won
I had the presence to announce
so once again
the two males could pounce
upon each other to embrace
you've won
I yelled

you proved your absolute obedience
he actually believed it all,
so dense
he is...
he told me to my face
how he was victor for the human race
he was so proud
gone far beyond all common sense
