Flame
	feathers
	over the caring
	of things
between random and ready
fade
	to a kite
	if strongly held
	knows
	wings
Find
	a sharing
	in those
	who reflect
however unsteady
what flashes
	in movement
	seems free
	but is only fast
	and held fast for
part of that
cursoring blue
there are always
strings
