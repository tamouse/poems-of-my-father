Half a circle round the bus-tour guide
Inside his own half circle, where the great men
enstone his country's history in pride,
some children scramble on and off again
away from earth a little, climb, leap. land
The guide seems somewhat bothered by it all
He gestures with his head, hand held in hand
the hidden fingers where... the hand so small?

He praises these great men, a cut-off tale
great empire shrunk to dominated form,
the silicon age the children scale
our guide oh no, forgetting , raises his arm
forgotten hand, or hand he can not find
to point to one more statue of a king;
not gesture with, No tourist mind

provides such closure.  Not some little thing
a metal form, carved wood, to fit a glove
		to show concern,
one child his wrist bent in play...
not what this government was thinkng of...
a child's sleeved arm points handless our guide's way.
