title: "Big Idea"
---

Your hand just now
that rested on my arm
brought me images of love
or is that word too big

a more specific word is trust,
for you can rest your hand on me
any time you want to.
Still a closer word
is touch,
but what filled my head
importantly
was hand-on-arm
which soon gave way to still
another word:
hand.
