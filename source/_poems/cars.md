title: "Cars"
---

Cars in the parking lot  do not sleep,
thumbs of light off glass and chrome
stab into offoces amd classrooms
studying shoulders, backs, and necks:
people are delicious,
cars have recipes.

Welcoming the people
who crawl willingly
into over-cushioned stomachs
to hide what they will do;
some slowly disappear
a satisfying meal.

Waiting for the people
who morning come in busily
who evenings go out tiredly
degested into systems
of petroeum and steel.

Watching for the people
so buckling steel can masticate
the gentleness of arms and legs
that will no longer feel.

Cars in the parking lot do not sleep
patient in their hunger they watch all afternoon.
