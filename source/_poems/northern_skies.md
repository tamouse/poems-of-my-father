title: "Northern Skies"
---

The sky above this garden is a-blaze <br />
With shimmer running almost to Orion; <br />
A ghostly movement crosses half the sky <br />
A living luster trembling through a phase.

Finding star-to-star form we plan by, <br />
Remembering by murmuring of ion, <br />
Here between a willow and the stream, <br />
Let's wait awhile to watch our planet dream.
