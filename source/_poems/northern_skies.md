title: "Northern Skies"

The sky above this garden is a-blaze
With shimmer running almost to Orion;
A ghostly movement crosses half the sky
A living luster trembling through a phase.

Finding star-to-star form we plan by,
Remembering by murmuring of ion,
Here between a willow and the stream,
Let's wait awhile to watch our planet dream.
