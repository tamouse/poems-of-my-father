title: "Founders' Vision"
---

The pathway leads
beside the river
where brambles tear
the ground
where water seeps
makes each step
mindless
of its own direction

somehow
I move against the river
to see
far off
across a grid of thorny branches
the feeding ponds
with tended poles
from which
the lamps of Eden
shine a music
for the families
who work
the rafted gardens.
