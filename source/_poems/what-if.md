title: "What If"
---

When I was young I had great cause to wonder
at all the views that traveled through my mind,
all this world with pieces of another
which has more marvels, dealing less with time
(time in the sense of passages exact
inside a world of animal and plant).

While living we don't know
			which works we plant,
not for ourselves so not for one another.
The price which careless messages exact,
small pain ignored, give also cause for wonder
that we do so few damages in time
with all the loves and care we fail to mind.

The earthling with his hand-eye working mind
rests eagerly with numbers seen exact
such as the measured money, weight and time,
length, forcefulness which easily implant
a system leaving little cause for wonder;
one set as meaningful as any other.

With much of this world little of another
together we give too much thought to time
which leaves us not enough concern to wonder
at what is a truer nature of the mind
accustomed to environments of plan
and animal, each in a space exact.

What if the world unmeasured, inexact,
let plant like animal, like humans wonder?
What would we have to say to such a plant?
What if one animal and then another
should need a close attention from our mind
enrooted in full sun scaled in slow time.


What if we learned to live outside of time,
communicating slowly with each plant
or reached beyond our world to timeless mind
into some realm outside this scope exact;
some universal consciousness or other,
some flow of strong awarenesses or wonder.

In my young time I had full cause to wonder.
With nothing too exact within my mind
I let one world plant promise for another.
