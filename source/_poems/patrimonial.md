My father's lantern
       swinging in his hand
	cast shadows
	      as he walked
		across the snow
		      each step
			went over hills
    	                     forever

My father saw his children
       leave the farm
	one by one
	       like harvest times
		  that cropped
		       his loves
                          his lives

My father's one regret
      when his last autumn came
	he could not finish
	      digging
		the potatoes
		     and it was
	                  a good year
  	                        for potatoes
