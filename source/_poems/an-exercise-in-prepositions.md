title: "An Exercise in Prepositions"
---

They built a bridge to drive
  across the river
They pulled a hundred fishes
  from the river
Those who hoped to learn
  the river
  tried
Those who claimed to save
  the river
  lied

They dumped the city garbage
  in the river
They cooled the stores and buildings
  with the river
Two laughing kids who drank
  the river
  died
The lonely ones who loved
  the river
  cried
