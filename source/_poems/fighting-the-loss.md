title: "Fighting the Loss"
---

*( an archeologist finds a tiny
fertility goddess long buried )*

Antique respect for hope and birth
perhaps a symbol of the wise
at any rate it has lost the worth
and calm clear light behind the eyes


the legs are smooth
smooth too the bust
above it is rough
this tiny size
demanding love
and more
demanding trust


what has been lost
oh what a storm
of promised pulse
of swell and thrust
we do not even care
now form
is all, is all.
