title: "The Birds"
---


the birds are fighting again; friendly terms
I like to think, discussion fruit or worms
the blackbird chants his claim to own the tree
A martinet says lark, the rest agree
the robin hopes a vote will help decide
the bluejay swipes the prize he has no pride
when bigger birds engage in all this grief
the last wren hides behind a wren-size leaf
how much is  joy or play or pain or shame
for birdbrains working this skylarking game?
one more unknown--a great x to pursue...
which we must learn; it has so much to do
along with quasar quark and shooting star
with just what kind of universe we are
