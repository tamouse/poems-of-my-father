title: "Now"
---

However much we work and win and laugh
and boast historic monuments supreme,
build on older masteries; the theme
all charged with our best thoughts,
		our group belief
in their eternity is foolish--brief
is the "forever" of our dazzling dream.
No matter how magnificent they seem
they blow away with their own epitaph.

The door to this already is ajar:
the pictures we design, the words we write,
may last a little longer than we do,
then crunch into a nothingness, with new
and old alike all gone.  So what we are
is "now" --this timeless time-- and appetite.
