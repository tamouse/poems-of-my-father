print your name on the dotted line
your first name. No, your very first name:
your name before that, before the syllable
you knock around with day to day
your first name, not that,
keep trying. Maybe you will get it tomorrow.

Print where you were born
Not the city, this is not geography class.
No, not that. This is not anatomy class.
the place the universe made for you.
Keep trying, Ask around.
Maybe you will get it tomorrow.

Print your profession.
Beyond what you get paid for
Designate your function.
What does the universe have going
that it would not have without you.
What is it you will have done
after you are not remembered anymore.

How is it you go on without this information?
Who you are, where you are, what you are.
Somehow this must be provided
for the space
that you must break into
print
