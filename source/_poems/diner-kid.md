This is the Diner Kidd.
I work in a little diner
that looks like an old street car.
Long and narrow and yellow
like a cable car without imagination.

I'm the won hoo clozuz at nite because
the otherz R afraid.
I'm a frade too but wot the hey.
What scairs  reelie is the voices I
here.  If I saw as much as  eye here
that wood be a caseof hallucination.
Sounds arnt a nuff.
But I doo here things.
Ecksept when  aye member to wear
my aluminium foil hat.
Then I hear nuthing. Not even all the
uther ppl have left to go home or off
to after concert parties.
I sed clozus.  Weer open tho unitl
too a m or later.

Akshewlee until no one is around to
feed burgers too
or even a pot of beans.

en way U wanna wotch wots here
because on Nov one I am really going
stark wild crazy right in a novel.

Im gunna prack tiss a lot to.
