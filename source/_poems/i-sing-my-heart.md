title: "I Sing My Heart"
---

I sing my heart out in a wilderness
like a victim of some violence
too horrible to tell.  My private fate
that will not let itself be known until
--on this calm afternoon of blind distress--
a final mistic ignorance descends
while those more competent than I await
to sing much louder their soft vesper hymn.
I listen for a shushing antinym.
