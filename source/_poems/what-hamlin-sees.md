title: "What Hamlin Sees"
---

What I see out my window is snow
		and exciting woodlands
what I  hear from the playground is
		ballgames and cheering
what I  read from friends is meaningful
		in caring and sharing
what I try to give back is caring
		and feelings of life
love of life

I know many people suffer
		only because they
have no one to talk to
to write  so I write I write to those
who never answer
I write to those
who can't write
I write to those who answer
every letter
I write to those
who are fooling me
I write  to those
who really need some words
I write to the old people
I write to the young people
words for the parents
who dont know how to tell
their children that they love them
     A love too long untold
