title: "No Room"
---

No room for one more photograph; these walls
are full. no frame can hold a picture quite so small
that it would fit within the space between
one image or another. All these rooms
are taken and the house will have no more.
I must go on to find outside a place
to nail my thoughts or give creation up.

The galleries are ready for  a younger voice
the ticket buyers ask which ones are new

The faces that look at me /wink and/ laugh
these faces I had loved and now I half
remember or some not at all

The walls have no more room
for painted images or photographs
the years have been too good
remembrances that leave out
grief and sad encounters
edge each other for attention
