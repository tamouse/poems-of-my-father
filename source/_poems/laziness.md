title: "Laziness"
---

We washed each tin can as we ate the soup;
We folded cardboard when they mailed us books;
We stopped the poison on the lawn--if looks
And weeds get worse, we said,
		let neighbors snoop.
We were a righteous, an important, group.

We built up compost,
                 cleaned out trash from brooks;
We spoke of wastrels as moronic crooks.
We were fantastic, a most loyal troop.
But did we stop the ammunition train;
Did we protest when children's funds were cut;
New prisons built, and  welfare clinics shut;
Or write a letter about acid rain?
We watched the news: they meant to entertain;
A bread and circus politician's strut.
