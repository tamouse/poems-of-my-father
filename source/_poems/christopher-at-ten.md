title: "Christopher at Ten"
---


I wouldn't mind
having a friend
who could pick up an axe
swing it true with skill and joy
cut wood
I wouldn't mind
teaching any rule
rack the balls  pick up a cue
lose to him at pool
I wouldn't mind
meeting
a mountain child
whose thinking was
five thousand
years ago
first styled
