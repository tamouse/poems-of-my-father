title: "Lockable Shell"
---

a semi-picnic
in our half-built house
a cage-like structure
where we sit
teetering on joists
the sunlight free
through walls
reflecting board off board
a play of dust and angles
shaping us inside
the iridescence
of our semi-precious years

we planned
too young
to have a house
you dreamed
each part superbly placed
money lenders though
require squared off corners
enforcing on our space
a cubist non-concern
we still have what we need
a living room
two eyes a nose et cetera
the relative positions
seem to matter less and less

eager to leave
old rented views
to get on
with split-level modes
away from unknown lights
that flicker in dark doors
although even here
the odds on rainy days
have thrown a roof
between us and a sky

we have a plot
for morning glories
near a tree
palmed skyward to grow
the substance of a house

where as yet
no separations rise
nothing has been lost
no clutter complicates the day

which
however perfect now
we move to have a shell
enclose the sea-sound
of our lives.
