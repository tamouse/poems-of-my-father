title: "Jade Carving Two"
---

A oalace of rocks, a drink-deep moat
Of mountain's glacier splashes cold,
Twisted among the struggled trees.

Cold helps the ardent man devote
His tme andstrength, as he grows old,
Tot asks best done each day on knees.

The sound of swirling wind off snow,
Adrift with darkened clouds, has told
How rough the weathering day will go.
