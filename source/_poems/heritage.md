not a word, no not a sound
about the money let him bring it  up
that's how he gets attention
he thinks its him we want around
he carries on his little spats
I think I should just chuck it all
say how it really is with us
and let him will his wealth to cats

to cats and dogs he threatens to you know
he talks about his money leaving it
to charity who would think
that feeble body would go on and go
past a century without a sign
of ever freeing us of it
I'm seventy and carrying
this wasted man around this dad of mine

what I should do is drop him let him fall
the length of the  stairway tumble down
from step to step to hear me laugh
blessed relief to show him show them all
to lose so much that woman he called wife
mother to me god rest her soul
he never gave her much
neither a long nor a goodly life
death for her a well earned rest

he's lived without her five times longer
than they were with each other
those years were not his best

If he had died when she died
what a blessing what if she
had lived to see the years grow bright
her children strong in  wealth and pride
the awful lack of industry replaced
by healthy work her grandsons
working their women those who wanted jobs
have jobs with loveliness their lives are graced

no worries larger than a dance
or love affair which as you say
is worry large enough imagine
a concern for family size finance
