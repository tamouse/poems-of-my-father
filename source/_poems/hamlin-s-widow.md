title: "Hamlin's Widow"
---

When he looks at the window he sees specks
enduring glass, frame edges that need paint,
collections of a world of dust with stained
reminder of the children who reflect..

Wen he looks in the window, he sees now --
The furniture, her things that decorate,
a table top, a stand, the TV screen
They watch together after dinner, how
the years have changed some things, while others wait
While decades pass; a comfortable scene.

When he looks out the window to inspect
the trees he planted, all those that remain
provide them too much shade.  What has gained:
success in life too late now to reject..
