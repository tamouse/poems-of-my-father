When David McDee read the news on TV
There never was murder or stealth
Just birthdays and weddings (new recipes, too)
And people inheriting wealth.

How Mrs. McDee's flower bed came along,
How neighbors had torn down the fence.
Such positive bits of informative news
To David, made imminent sense.

Soon arsonists found they were fresh out of work;
Oil profits had lost half their fun;
What's the use in sensation if nobody knows,
If the news won't include what is done.

When David McDee read the news on TV,
The weather was sunshine and warm.
The sports casts concerned only games
		that were won;
All losses considered bad form.

When David McDee read the news on TV
Pure innocence lighted our eyes
There were no surprises or odd little wrongs:
All greetings and never goodbyes
