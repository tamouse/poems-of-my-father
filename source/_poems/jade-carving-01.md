title: "Jade Carving One"

A palace of fallen rocks redressed,
Time-decorated in the green
Of midget brush, primeval moss;

Cloud degrees of gray, near-white is best
To mute the shade of this tinted scene.
Wind-bent, storm-shaped treetops toss

The free-form curtain clouds apart:The welcome rocky
path be seen.
Whre can a plain man hope to start?
