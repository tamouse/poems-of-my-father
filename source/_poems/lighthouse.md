We'll have to raise the light above the trees
so the foundering ship will come to us
her cargo splashing close
so we can get it.
The sailors will be lost
as good as lost unless the poor souls think
our wretched village better than what they left:
stolen off a city street as boys
and put to work as men.
otherwise we shove them out on rafts
let nature take its course.

A good part of our people
came here wretches off a ship,
no home to speak of... here we stay.
Now another crew comes floating in.

Once a crate of books washed up;
now what would this town do with books.
Bertie took them, said he'd like to try
to figure out some words.
That made a joke for weeks around the town;
our tavern crowd can keep a good one going
quite a while.

We had him tear the pages out, make little boats
to give him something closer to a job
than muttering to himself
about some marks smeared on a page.
We watched them--oh, a dozen at a time--
tossed on the waves, get water-logged, go down.
A few though would just float away.
You wonder where they'd get to.

One day Bert decided he'd find out,
went off himself just floated out.

We yelled,  told him the bore
would rip him off too far
to swim back in.  He floated off.
you think it may be that he got somewhere?
