title: "Moon"
---

One evening I reach up to move the moon
just a little so the spread of light
avoids that spot of dirt upon the floor
not that I find so much about that dirt
be something I'd object to not at all
hmm, part of the reason is to  tease the cat

yes indeed the quick pounce of the cat
upon that spot of lucence from the moon
she always wants to chase to hunt for all
the moving objects even shapes of light
my motivation is to hide the dirt
not that it matters what is on the floor

what is important not this messy floor
not so much what's upset by the cat
and not a question of a little dirt
not even real concern about the moon
or whether I have something against light
no, for desire for something must be all

It's reaching out to have, to keep it all:
philosophy: ambition, build a floor
of consciousness a mental light
so bright that some attention to a cat
not staring like a bunny at the moon
or worrying about a bit of dirt

.
        	( the cat's conception is ignore the dirt )
	finding what it is that ruins all
	heroic efforts to be on the moon
     	to build ourselves a roof
			four walls a floor
	with some provision to have food to eat
	along with a machine to make some light

.
	a safety measure; many times a light
	makes our lives easier... avoiding dirt
	is one of them with everything we eat
	but hardly ever do we think at all
	of what a night time shine
			puts on the floor
	( for cat's sake, I reach up
			to move the moon )
