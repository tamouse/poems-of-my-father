title: "About Nothing"
---


when I was six and reading
aloud to the class
and to the teacher
to prove
I was there

the word NOTHING
lay upon the page
with no clue within its sentence
within its context
with no way to pronounce:
No THING
sure to be a snicker

yes, that was what it meant

then the teacher
anxious to cut short
the silence
rowdy-type students
are eager to fill

gave it to me
NUTHING
