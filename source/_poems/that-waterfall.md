title: "That Waterfall"
---

That waterfall, its energy, such waste,
so profligate our earth is, so much time
to spin around, a top, a toy, so blue
and green, great clumps of grey
		and white and years:
a hundred thousand for a cliff to break
off one small bit of rock; the canyon grows
by inches -- millimeters then -- refaced
with fresher elements.  God only knows
how long a planetoid may take
to form a half-way stable cliff that shears
away thin layers, how long to see it through,
change habit, heap up mountains,
		do earthquakes,
add thought, become aware of jokes and fears,
format a word, within a mind, for rhyme.
