When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Your friends will think it's poetry, you know.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.

A cherch√© word is a linguistic crime.
Use normal speech, with touches of argot.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.

Bring friends who quote you, say "That sounds
sublime."
Bring your own booklet, everywhere you go.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.

If, by chance, you can't think of the right word

 Fast  enough, don't let the tension climb;
               hum a little, mumble something low.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.

If "at home" won't fit, try "chez moi," "zu Heim"
Or "en casa," whatever seems more
		"comme il faut."
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.

Never let a line end awkwardly,  I'm
Sure you will agree.  Keep proper stress also.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.
