I'd like to go back to the good old days
when we were together two friends
but nothing so delicate ever stays
ephemeral means it soon ends

those days were friendly and sporty
those days were happy and fine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we went fishing but there was no nibble
our bobbers just floated around
but we found no reason to quibble
we examined a rock we had found

and a butterfly wing and a dorty
then back to the cabin to dine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we built a campfire for cooking
but couldn't find very much wood
so there we were I somehow looking
so stupid right there where I stood

but you said, "oh what does it matter
we'll go buy a bundle of pine"
when I was but forty and fatter
and you were a lady of nine

you needed more tail on your spring kite
and I couldn't find any string
the whole project just wouldn't go right
so instead you decided to sing

well I didn't know how to fly it
but the sun continued to shine
I was forty and needed to diet
and you were a lady of nine

you skinned your knee it was bleeding
but you wouldn't shed any tears
just a band-aid was all you were needing
and help with the bicycle gears

I came with a small pair of pliers
a band-aid and no iodine
I was forty and good with spare tires
and you were a lady of nine
             1985
