I'd like to go back to the good old days
when we were together two friends
but nothing so delicate ever stays
ephemeral means it soon ends

those days were friendly and sporty
those days were happy and fine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we went fishing but there was no nibble
our bobbers just floated around
but we found no reason to quibble
we examined a rock we had found

and a butterfly wing and a dorty
then back to the cabin to dine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we built a campfire for cooking
but couldn't find very much wood
so there we were I somehow looking
so stupid right there where I stood
