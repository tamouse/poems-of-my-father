I'd like to go back to the good old days <br />
when we were together two friends <br />
but nothing so delicate ever stays <br />
ephemeral means it soon ends

those days were friendly and sporty <br />
those days were happy and fine <br />
when I was a young lad of forty <br />
and you were a lady of nine

we went fishing but there was no nibble <br />
our bobbers just floated around <br />
but we found no reason to quibble <br />
we examined a rock we had found

and a butterfly wing and a dorty <br />
then back to the cabin to dine <br />
when I was a young lad of forty <br />
and you were a lady of nine

we built a campfire for cooking <br />
but couldn't find very much wood <br />
so there we were I somehow looking <br />
so stupid right there where I stood
