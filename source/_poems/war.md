title: "War"
---

Rather than to treat the topic war
Ignore
Atrocities of nations raging mad.
We've had
Too much to do with power and press.
The mess
That runs world-wide across our lands
And hands.

But if a man in uniform came by,
We'd cry
For dead or legless children in his arms.
What harms
Us most is knowing just one face to face
Disgrace,
So can we hope for normal happiness?
Try 'yes.'

There was a child once in a photograph
With half
Her skin charred black, her clothing gone,
Still on
And on she goes, as does her scream.
No dream
Today can be complete without her fear
Held dear.

Whatever megadeaths we learn to deal
We feel
Projections prove we'll lose but half our race.
We face
The future confident. That screaming child,
Reconciled.
Will not die --live forever-- facts are in
Her skin.
