We have an old guest coming, have you heard?
We speak of Seneca, a friend conjured
In our own garden, he will walk tonight
With me. I don't know how he comes. No  fright
Or problem is with him... says, "He who fears,
Serves," then tips his head,
		waits for what appears
To be his wanting me to catch the sense,
The gist, of what he says. Alert, not tense,
As used to others who must take a while
To understand his words. A cautious smile...

What form is he in?  Well, I hardly glanced
At him... his very presence somehow entr√°nced
Me so, I do not know.... I go again.

Oh, no, a skeleton?  So can all men
Who die and then return not wear some skin,
Be more presentable.  I'll wrap him in
A robe to hide his face... I mean his skull.
Yuck... neighbors... God knows who...their lives so small.
     Complain at each least thing they find.

Please sit, Dear Seneca, we'll talk as we commit
This interview...  Your trip from death...
		You're cold?
Well, good, I meant this quilt to warm some old
Loved bones. Not quite like yours, I must admit;
But welcome, Seneca,

.
                                I say, please sit.
You'd rather walk and talk? Of course, that's fine.
Here, in my backyard garden: columbine,
There, lilacs now in bloom...
                 You haven't seen
Such elegance in yards?  Come now, you mean
You, guest of emperors...
		            What's that you said?
At dinner you admired the foods we had?
Far better than you've known. We live such great,
Uncomplicated lives? You think so? Wait!
I'll show you problems yet.
			But, you go first:
Tell me your thoughts, your plans.
	                        ...Yes, I have thirst
For many books. A score? Good grief, a score?
Why, say a thousand books, no, even more.

Too many, do you think?  I read too much?
You think that's possible?
	                                Ah, to lose touch
With one's stability...
				Too many trips?
That too?  Indeed, qualify... It's like the sips
That tease but do not quench.

.
		I would have thought
The more the better, sir; so I have bought
Books I will never read,  I would have said
More travel better than...
170
	             But you have had
More opportunity, zipping about
In heaven, flying free...

.
                            I do not doubt
A word you say, OK... you never fly.
To stay at home is wise?  Where one must try
To take in one thought deeply, not skirt more
Than one can understand, full of dark lore
Without the learner's light. As you can't read
All that you have, enough is all you need:
Have only what you read.
			So much like Christ;
They say you do compare...
			An overpriced
Poseur?  Our Saviour?  You've talked, you two?

As everybody talks with You-Know-Who?
That's thrilling?
			Dull?
				Not dull; our Jesus?
			Next
To God for conversation.
				Much too perplexed?

Too much involved with saving those over-sexed
Or over-something sinners wrapped in crime.
So, you have talked with God?



A waste of time.
Head-in-the-Clouds!
			His head...
                                  it  is a cloud!
That I can comprehend. Uh, please... the shroud
Uh, please arrange the quilt.  That's fine.
                                          What's clear
Dear friend:  A grinning skull that gives no fear
Is friend indeed.
		Good-by, if you think
You really have to go   Stay for a drink?
No way for you to drink? Just ancient bones,
That's why you show distaste--those edgy tones--
When speaking about flesh and blood.  Your cause
Of death! That simple blood could flow, that laws
Bring such a bitter end,  I should have known.

But as you go, you promise to be back?
You have important knowledge that we lack,
And must be told, about the universe
From Eve and Adam, how they lived their curse
Into a legend honored with this earth,

The sole exception: the place of birth
Remains a place we do not know...

.
			So, then,
You promise we will  hear from you again:

Get drunk enough, you say.
	This plum tree...
			Where
Has he gone now? ...Into thin air.
