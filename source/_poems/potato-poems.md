11 batata

ground apple papas kartolfen krumpli;
what would it have
been in latin had they known what
    mystic consideration in antique Pharsee

POTATO 6 (found poem)
one measure of rutabaga
one measure of apple
one measure of potato
mashed together
heaven and earth

potato poem

smooth reaches of white
insides
barely discernable structure

only the eyes are obvious
whether the skin
be light, dark,
proud red
secretly divine russet

only the eyes
spiral on the outer skin
in perfect fibonacci sequence

like the psychological framework
of something growing
in the unaware reaches
of the human mind

POTATO 8

north of Bubba
you have your mashed potato,
baked potato, twiced baked potato, fries, curly fries....

POTATO 7

a rifle, three twenty-two longs, salt, a dog,
a friend, two kitchen matches,
two unharvested potatoes neglected in the field,
for a feast in the woods of potato and partridge

POTATO 9

twenty-five-mile wide
lump
shaling debris
in the plummet around the sun
