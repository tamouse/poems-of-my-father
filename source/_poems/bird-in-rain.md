title: "Bird In Rain"
---

so often in the rain a bird sits still
to wait for sunshine, or a worm to show
she fluffs her feathers for a cooling grace
sometimes one bird of birds in a line
will drop, some force has come to kill
her deep inside, or it is time to go
the other birds move in to fill that space
they wait some more at last a day's sunshine
means they fly off, at work they do not know
one of their number leaves without a trace
that later time allows some gross divine
exert a detumescence at its price:
wide circles, circles, mark a bird's decline
with built-in wobbles, round with sun and rain.
