title: Granddaughter
---

Spinning in cloth of wonder child I grow
with; backyard swingset, sandpile, garden, tree,
Our bench. We sit, hear humming one slow bee;
So deep in profuse clover can it know
How strung to threadbare land and sky we go,
Ragged together, hemming sand to sea,
Spider to tailor; nothing free or free
To lose for all things lend as all things owe.

Warm blanket life, each child unknowing wraps
Near perfect patterns we all have, but one
By one fall tangled years. A dream perhaps
That only children know: the world is spun.
Granddaughter, young enough to understand
That we reach upward for a loving hand
