The gods, we thought, are pleased,
		for a majestic beast
that towered on the sea
		was coming from the east
to visit us.  We saw a worm upon its skin--
no, those were crawling men
		who somehow lived within.

They had no birth or death--no woman came along,
but they took ours.
	They did not know that it is wrong
to take our women; take our goods,
		to take and thieve...
such alien behavior.

They could not achieve
plain fatherhood alone but on our common beach
each took a turn upon each maid;
		then went to reach
For yellow metal things of ours we did not use
except to fasten feathers.

We could afford to lose
this stuff, we learned to let them have it;
		brought with smiles
to them what water-rounded stones we had...
		small piles
grew on their decks.

411
	     We did not let them see the plumes
within our forest cache;
		the sacred tree-made rooms
of truly valued stock.

At last one day they left.
They had not learned of the most horrid,
		dreaded theft:
the sacred feathers.

What they did take, had not much
to do with life; but left with us a stronger touch
of death.  They could undo us, cut us all apart
with magic sticks that they could stab into a heart
or slice off arms,
	           or point a hand-sized thunder blast
straight into us with angry slashing teeth.

The last
we saw of them, they floated off.
			A sickness in our men
and women stayed behind.
		To make them whole again
we gathered in
	     our Clearing-Of-All-Wrongs around
the dead and dying with our drums and masks.

We found
that using what our wisest shaman knew
			-- till dawn
we tried --  that all the cures went bad:
		our gods were gone.
