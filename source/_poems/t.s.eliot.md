title: "T S Eliot"

He was so matter of fact telling the news about the universe.
When that got old, the universe,
still young, had nothing much
for anyone to tell about.
Later, when, like Einstein.
we came to understand him,
the truths had changed.
Still there is power
in what we thought he knew;
one head challenging
the galaxies
to give up pictures of their skeletons.
I should have taken the bicycle tour
it couldn't have been harder and a lot cheaper
and faster
