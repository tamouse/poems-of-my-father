title: "Alphabet"
---

the O is first
a rank above all others
holding its simple surprise

then is S
wanting to strike
or warn about striking
not merely to pluralize

M
perhaps is first after all
taking the least effort
a vehicle for music
and for seeming wise

E
a set of shelves
hanging around all over
most unique and useful
when silent

And so it goes
the alphabet all wrong
All the orders
in the encyclopedium
all the seating charts
in the classes
telling people
who gets to sit
in the back of the room
