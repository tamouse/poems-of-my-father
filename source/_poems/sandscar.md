title: "Sandscar"
---

on wire wheels the robot buggy creeps along
upon a grainy bed of rocks pulverized
by blow on blow of little bits
once eager to be planets
settling now to be a trifle grain of sand
upon a smiling moon.

the tracks it leaves
are straight and slowly formed
by a control a hundred thousand leagues away

is anything there that moves
any sign of at all
that something happened once
that something came along
just now
or long ago
