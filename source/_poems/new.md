Now is the time for something new,
we have enough of what is old,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

All digital and not coucou,
not magic woods with bridges trolled,
now is the time for something new.

A drink of marvelous fresh brew
Effervescently kept cold,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

Not tapestries now turning blue,
pages yellowed that can't fold,
now is the time for something new.

Who cares what Aristotle knew?
What do latest studies hold?
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

Modernity must now eschew
what has faded, smells of mold,
now is the time for something new.
Razzle dazzle and frou-frou.
