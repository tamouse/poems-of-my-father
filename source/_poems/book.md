There must be something to this book he wrote
I tried an outline, couldn't find a thread;
Something to rememeber, lines to quote

I read the whole book, couldn't take a note
All these words, what is it he has said
There must be something to this book he wrote

The need for meaning gathered in my throat
To find where all his learn√®d effort led
Something to remember, lines to quote

His images, not especially vague, remote.
Where precisely have my senses fled?
There must be something to this book he wrote

From all angles no way does it denote
Some light to guide us as most books have shed
Something to remember, lines to quote

Perhaps it's just his way to stay afloat
As a professor, publish or be dead.
There must be something to this book he wrote
Something to remember, lines to quote
