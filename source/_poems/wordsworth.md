The daffodils are strong when they in groups
upon the hill have danced where Dorothy
has seen them; suddenly, a burst of light.
She brought me lines that I was pleased to use
and hardly change, but other flowers here
are far more delicate, although not rare;
such rarity not always what it takes
to seem too rich and precious to destroy.
I think especially of  violets.
Dear Dorothy has told me she has seen
these flowers in the lawn where as we walk
our feet crush two or three with every step;
as if we were not quite allowed to walk
on earth, great bumbling burdens that we are;
Or walk with a permission and a love.
These are not the minions of nature
like hills that brood above me on the lake
or sing a joy of life. These little ones
are almost secret in a beautiful
and waiting life.  "They also serve who ...wait?"
They do and so do we: they make us think
that we must delicately go considering
the smallest things of earth as part of life
of us the patient voices underfoot:
Take care with each new step or all is lost.
I said that daffodils are strong, but here
a strength that is beyond what we can know
from far outside our lives, comes into us.
These violets will not  be turned away
I've seen men turn the soil where violets
were growing, men believing they destroyed
the little flags of sky that hide between
the vigorous and overtaking green.
Then three or even four years later
walking on the cultivated fields
the grass defeated for the sake of beets
I find between the rows and in the rows
the violets alive as ever,  seeds
of these contrary bits of loveliness
have waited, waited and then sprung to life
to call the farmer to  his task, to call
the color of defiance, to defy
all forces for the cause of life, of life
for its own sake, for messages that come
from an abiding  infinite in things,
the little  things, the least of these -- the Bible
has that phrase -- and who in that plowed field
were then about to own the very ground
or to inherit, as they say, the earth.
