title: "Hamlin's Line"
editor_note: >-

  This was occluded in the file with this poem:

  Mom's empire of acquired knick-knacks had finally come to the state of
  being shared among the daughters: the wall displays of plates, the
  desk top statuettes, the finer pieces of furniture, were all easily
  apportioned one by one to the daughter who wanted each item more than
  the others did. When they had finished, compromises and trade-offs
  accomplished, there remained the one last item, for me, the only
  son. They had all remained silent about the one piece they knew I
  would value above all others: the twig chair, the worn, almost useless
  creaky chair her father had made almost a century ago.

When Hamlin draws a line in thin air
his fingers trace a shape of strong allure
like nothing that has ever been before
we think we see what is not really there.

The shape becomes the life, the life of those
who tried to love him; loving him was all
they ever got to kjow of him..who knows
if he had more in him.  A pall
of vast unknowing--what they chose
to love was maybe real--or fictional.

He had no knack for drawing lines--his air
of acting like he knew--his sweet allure
let people think they knew him--loved him--for...
for what?  What they imagined, really, nothing there.
