title: "Mondrian III"

the dumb thing
flew right into that window
they'll do that
this time
so  hard
it broke the glass
that's unusual
but to stand there
holding the dead bird

not knowing
what to do with it
making a big deal of it
well most likely
needing
something to do
sitting by his window
all day
nothing done
