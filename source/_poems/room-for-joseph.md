title: Room for Joseph
---

Oh, yes, there were those voices in the air,
The tidings brought to Mary. What I heard
"Joseph, be content," seemed so unfair;
That I was not a whole man is absurd.

As smooth as any shank planed slick as skin
We fitted, in our sleeping, front to back
Or snug as mortised tenon, fitted in.
Go ask her, ask her, was there ever lack

Of manhood in me? Look, this chair, the grain
Curls up this leg just right. See that? And who
Found wood and let the shape of nature's wain
Become this resting curve, each turning true?

How is it then that I can be declared
Unfit, unlikely, or what words they chose,
As if my honored lineage were impaired
By noble age? That is what they suppose.

Oh, such a son we had!  When he was three
He asked, "What do you do with all these tools?"
He looked at backsaws, draw knives, chisels...
 		free
And open with his questions.  How the fools
Who heard him laughed. Then questions grew
 		too big.

"Was sharpness not the main part of my  trade?"
Or, "Was the tightness of the fitted jig
Set on the best wood how the best man made

The best frame?"  Questionings until I lost
The sense, sometimes. His mind jumped so.
 			"Don't use
Old wood for a new crib... for that can cost
You time and work with what good will you lose."

 We two, we peeled the bark, we squared
		the stock...
It's so much fun to work with your own kid.
We talked together as we planed a block;
How beauty rose inside the work we did

From deep within the wood.  "Had something
 		planned
That pattern, put it in for us to find
Truth there?"  I said, "You've got to understand:
Thoughts must be smaller, or we lose our mind."

But it was not his mind they took.  The hour
He heard me, and could simplify each thought,
So much a miracle,that gave him power
To focus wonder.  Then they came and caught

Him, hated him and found ways to destroy.
One simple answer:  "Look for a good life
And worry what 'good' is."  He is my boy.
They can't change that.  His mother is my wife.
