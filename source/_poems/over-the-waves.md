give them today
give them today today
just one more day
we'll see about the morning
in the morning.

Give them today
one cycled sun
some hours won
we'll see about the morning
in the morning.

Give them today
a certain bed
a body fed
their fear unsaid
give them today
their daily bread
we'll see about the morning
in the morning.
