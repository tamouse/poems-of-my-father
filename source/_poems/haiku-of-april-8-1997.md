editor_notes: >-
  These were written on the page as \"haiku n of 4/8/97\". I took some
  editorial license with them.

  \"irgin coral forvest\" is how it's written in the original. it
  should probably read \"virgin coral forest\", but maybe that is
  intentional?

  Missing #9

*1*
loons cry
across flat swamp
blueberries

*2*
irgin coral forvest
upwells, nourishes
inner city hood

*3*
plant the brick
next to the other brick
room between for grass

*4*
step on my body
prone to punishment
pressed to earth

*5*
shift down
grind metal teeth spit gravel
at the past

*6*
knee thigh
warm new
already taken

*7*
spindle sharp curse
blood condition
only a hundred years

*8*
thief searches
others' possession not valued
take

*10*
shoveling snow
light inside
diamonds

*11*
silver and green
leaves of silver poplar
imitating   maple

*12*
hot chocolate
with marshmallows
jungle and swamp

*13*
frying pan spider
whatchamacallitthingy
the eggs are up

*14*
drifts so deep
in over my head
what else is new

*15*
butcher paper
wraps a candy valentine
presence of blood

*16*
flood covers everything
as far as we can see
even worms and bugs

*17*
periferal vision
lost
one pixel at a time

*18*
crib back to the attic
after all the waiting time
no sleep
