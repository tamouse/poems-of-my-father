title: "Inside Me"
---

there's a kid who lives inside me
who doesn't like my life
he wasn't ready for the things
that led to all this strife

there's a kid who lives inside me
who keeps looking through my eyes
he tries to tell me where to go
and what to do, he tries

I pretend I haven't even heard
the pesky way he nags
finally I tell him he's absurd
so then he chokes, he gags

there's a kid who lives inside me
who keeps listening through my ears
he teases me. he pesters me
he plays upon my fears

he keeps thinking that he has control
forgets he's locked inside
he wants me to go swimming
to play ball to go and slide

he's a loser he's a pouter
he's a loner he's a kluts
he says I'm a down and outer
hanging idle smoking butts

get lost I tell him it's my time
to develop with  my friend
you brat you dunce out of my heart
you force me to pretend

and then I think perhaps that kid
is part of  my life still
I remember all the things he did
but oh he can get shrill

he gets nasty nasty really weird
like almost gone insane
he stomps and says he'll pull my beard
he shrieks inside my brain

he'll stamp his feet upon my heart
he'll stomp his feet and shout
he wants more of the acive part
or else he's coming out
