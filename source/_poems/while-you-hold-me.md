title: "While You Hold Me"
---

While you hold me
there will work no wrong
while I hold you
there will come no chill
your warmth is surer
than this very sun
a trust rekindles
as its fires cool

Keep me, then;
inside this world's light
I grow in you
another life and realm
call help me when
I hear its cold invite
which I must welcome
or indeed untell
