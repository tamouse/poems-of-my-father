title: "Because of You"
---

Because of you
	I hear the magic of their strings
Because of you
	I see the beauty
		of the statue in the park
Because of you
	the sunlight
		warms a softer earth
Because of you
	my day goes on
		a rich arising ride
Because of you
	the night time silence
		fills with innocence
Because of you
