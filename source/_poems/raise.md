title: "Raise"
---

I have raised my hand
no reason
no one is asking for an answer
it is all figured out
no questions come along

my hand is embarassed
but muy arm needs to hold it high
not to  get called on
not to go to the bathroom
the position relieves the muddied
pools of his badness

it is my arm that is raised
my arm as strong as
the will power to ignore
what is going on
