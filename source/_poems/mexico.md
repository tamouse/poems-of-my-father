the twelfth of January
Nineteen eighty-one

My dear,

Just received your letter
with the news
that you will spend two weeks
in Mexico.
I'll want to see your colored slides
when they are done;
you get so much of life
within each frame --
artist that you are.
You'll like it there

and see no beggars
except a village mother now and then
with one child wrapped within a shawl.
Here's hoping that you don't get sick
or robbed;
and Oh, my dear,
be careful with your camera in Mexico.

While I was there
a two-year-old
escaped from her mother's shawl.
Charming toddler,
trusting among strangers.

I stopped to time the light,
to frame the scene;
lucky, I thought, to be a witness.
The mother swept up the child,
angry that a photograph
would lift some of the spirit
to be printed on a paper,
leaving the beloved one diminished.

So she believed.

As that Dutch painter
went to France
and gave his mind
in bits
to canvases
So he believed.

Well, as for that,
how much of life
will be consumed
of anyone
who tries to grasp
the golden point of view

Oh, how I ramble on.
My dear,

Be careful
with your camera
in Mexico.
