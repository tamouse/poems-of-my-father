---

Did you call my name?
I thought I heard you call my name.

No, I didn't call your name.

I distinctly heard your voice call my name

What else did you hear?

Nothing else, just that and just once.

Strange.  Did you see me, too?

No, just heard your voice.

Where did you think I was?

In the next room.

I was. If you see me and I am not there,
that will be serious.

Hearing is not serious?

Do you think it is?

No, I can just forget it.

Shall I mark it in the calendar?

If you want to.

We don't want you to go on hearing
what is not spoken.  That's hallucination.

What a dreadful word.

Isn't that right?  Hallucination.

What does it mean, where does it come from?

It means you think you hear me call
but I haven't.  Have you heard others?

No, just that.

What if you were to hear a car horn?

That's not so bad, so long as I don't
drive into the ditch to get out of the way.

Or a scream?

And I run to help someone who isn't there.

What are some words--let's make a
list of words you don't want to hear.

"Come here" would interrupt what I am doing.

Were you doing anything just now
when I called your name?
I mean when you thought I called your name?

I wonder, what it is--
the difference between
memory and imagination, and
in between hallucination.

What are you talking about?

Can I imagine a sound I've never heard?

If it's a word, yes.

Putting together sounds in ways I haven't heard?

I'm lost.

Can I imagine a trumpet if I've never heard a trumpet?

Not exactly.

Can I imagine a voice singing, a voice I've never heard?

A song yes, the words,  but not a new sound.

How does one create a new tune?

What a weird thought

Or a painting, that is not a memory.

Oh, you just splash it around and
decide what to keep.

Suppose I imagine a painting
of something I have never seen?

Can you do that?

Some people can.

No, I think they have paintbrush
accidents, happy ones,
they like what happens.

Do people sometimes talk that way?

That's crazy.

So, it scares me. What if
I am going crazy?  How do
I know if I am crazy or not?

What difference does it make?

Will anyone understand me?

I'm here.



What if I talk about things
or people that aren't there?

Not here, you mean.

What if I imagine a fifth primary color.

There are three.

No, there are four.

Oh, dear, would you like a bowl
of that soup I made?

You made soup?

You had some, just had some for lunch.

I don't remember.
