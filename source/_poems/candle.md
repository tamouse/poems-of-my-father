Have you seen my candle?
Yes, it's part of the exhibit.
I don't want to tell you
how many hours...
what do you think...

Really?
You have a good eye.

Um, Ma'am...
my candle.
That one.
I'd be embarrassed
to admit
how many hours...

Oriental influence, you think?
Concentricity
with justaposition
in the petrolocity of wax...

All that,
in my candle

I honor your opinion, madam.

So I went home
I tried again

No empathy, you said.

So...  years.
But, now,
a final form
avoiding flaw

 but you find a new direction
I could not have known

I will bring it in again
Time and again

Since i have found myself
to be a candlemaker

what else
have I
to do
