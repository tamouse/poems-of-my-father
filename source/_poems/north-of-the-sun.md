I   i
Emptly envelope
letter opened yesterday
skin of a secret

ii
Last year's calendar
all its secrets told and done
growing in heart-held value

Remembrance goes on
song of a sparrow heard still
after the songbird has flown

iii
shadows reach farther
after the heat of the day
heartaches are deeper
after the strength of the having
rest is the time for sorrow

Broken lines written
first in the soft easy clay
before the chisel
hammered white knuckled in stone
breaks in to last a lifetime

II  i
she will remember
her son in the city square
dreamer and student

ii
he had ideas
argumentative, learner
pushing for explanation
not like the others
happy to work to be told
he listened had to question

iii
he traveled from home
many miles seeking answers
wrote letters to her
strong in his love for them all
now no more letters arrive

all he had written
hidden away in a box
stored as a treasure
precious as rarest of stone
suffer this wealth a lifetime

III  i
stronger her love now
for the one who journeyed away
resting far from her

ii
her sorrow is strength
she grows in understanding
of why that son departed
looks at his old books
childhood readings and studies
knows his reasons for dying

iii
a passion for life
outweighed by measures of death
she hears his questions
she talks outloud to his chair
puts her hand on his pillow

he lives in her mind
what she knows now of learning
she loves deeply holds
firm ideas for living
will not see dying easy
