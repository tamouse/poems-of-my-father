because the kid without a mask was told
perhaps in earnest more likely though in jest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

at any rate his honest heart was sold
he was not of a mind to try a test
because the kid without a mask was told

if one can wait most aches and pains enfold
no more than time can slowly put to rest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

therefore forbearing years have gently rolled
still waiting for the time that is the best
because the kid without a mask was told

be patient and just wait be not too bold
behave meet life as an invited guest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

but explanations now do not unfold
not much can he of time or strength invest
because the kid without a mask was told
the problems all seem smaller when you're old
