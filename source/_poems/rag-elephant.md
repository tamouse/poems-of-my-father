*An admiration of a poem by*
*Carlos Drummond de Andrade*

The bones are pieces of a broken chair.
The skin is heavy cotton, wool for hair.
Buttons, of course, clever threads, a face.
Four walking cans. Ears; floppy pillowcase.

A rolled up trunk, eager to hold, to lift.
Real tusks. That lasting liquid eye, a gift.
On each side, glued-on flowers
and small clouds.

No one looks or smiles in all the crowds
He ambles through; so, tired past love tonight,
Each piece he will fold neatly, wrap just right.

For now, he strides, he sways.
He owns the street.
The tail almost drops off, cloth drags, his feet
Scrape.  The too-thin chair parts
creak and bend.
He is all grace; hoping to find a sad friend.
