title: "This is a Day"
---

this is a day the lord has made
filled with a holy faith and grace
into destruction we have strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face

we may well vanish without a trace
this is a day the lord has made
with a shadowed terror we must face
what land did we so swift invade

We've in what devil's thicket strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face
this is a day the lord has made
what demon chose we to embrace

with a shadowed terror we must face
such foolish victims, fools out-played
in burned out times in a desert place
this is a day that the lord has made
