title: "El Mirador"
---

I have been chosen,   I at age sixteen
the Keeper of the Sun has sent a guard
to bring me to what no one here has seen
a busy place which is all house and yard.
This honor so esteemed for me--it's hard
to understand, accept.   I go alone.
the first step, the great road, all polished stone

They take me. Mother kisses, father hands
me things: corn, sack of beans. His eyes are wet.
That   I am chosen out of all these lands:
an honor he and   I will not forget.
Now my soul mother, who taught me,   I let
her hands dress me once more,
		in feathered shells.
No longer simple, life in me foretells

Some act of greatness. Now, announcers shout.
The leader of the guard says "Time to start."
Sunrise it is, the guard and   I set out.
So proud   I am this day. Who wants my heart
Shall have it. and my strength, blood, part
Yes any of me, flesh or bone or thought.
More glory here than anyone has sought

We walk all day, next day, until five hours
past the second sunrise, skies in flame,
like flame too tree-high, higher, city towers.
Gods must have put them here. I cannot name
those gods; I only know why good rains came
and corn and sun, those gods.
		Now awed but weak,
past ancient worded walls that almost speak.

Now closer to the towers, I see rich rooms,
and ruling places, stones for sacrifice
With high steep climbs.
		Tall men wearing plumes
stand by me, take me. All gods have a price.
The body that was mine is theirs, is ice.
The Keeper cuts himself, stands high as sir.
Cuts tongue, an ear, and now; oh,no, look where.

Must he unsex himself? No, just three cuts
from which the blood now covers him, all red.
A field of people shout and cry. He struts
as I resume my climb, the guards ahead,
behind, to help. The Keeper close, not dead.
At last I stand where he stood. Cut, a stain
drips on me. Honored clothing gone. The pain.
