title: "Old Rusted Gate"
---

On the old rusted gate
where we boys loved to wait
until Mildred or Annabelle called
'Get off that old gate
You have stayed out to late
And we know you are not Archibald.
 For when Archibald swings
on that gate little things
go pitter and patter inside
both our hearts but your swings
give us no fluttered pings
Still we swing on the gate
Perhaps someday our fate
Will bring us the prize of their smile
Unless Archibald cries,
'I will blacken your eyes
and swing you around in great style.'
Oh the old rusted gate
for me and my mate
is a place to hang out with our hope
But Mildred and Ann
Want Archy or Dan
or anyone else to elope
for they've known us too long as just boys
who make gestures and immature noise
They don't know how full well we'd make good
on our boasts, we're just kids from the 'hood
But one of these days
we will earn honest praise
at last we will be understood
