I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
broad black hat and a polished cane
arranging careful each catch and drape

nothing is more important than an outward shape
a shining buckle and a silver chain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape

A mourning color, heavy voile or crepe
a distant love guitars a heart's refrain
arranging carefully each catch and drape
I love to watch the grubby neighbors gape
carefully avoiding any smudge or stain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape

all held together by the pins and tape
hooks are extra at the points of strain
arranging carefully each catch and drape

especially flattered when those lessers ape
proud and elegant--just short of vain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
arranging carefully each catch and drape
