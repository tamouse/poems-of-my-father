title: "Out of the Waves"

give them today today
give them today
just one more day
we'll see about the morning
in the morning

give them today
one cycled sun
some hours won
we'll see about the morning
in the morning

give them today
a certain bed
a body fed
their fear unsaid
give them today
their daily bread
we'll see about the morning
in the morning
