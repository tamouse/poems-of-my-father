  "At least fourteen of the names... were names of living men"
   -- New Yorker, Nov.30, 1992, p.41


---

A special trip to Washington.  A chill
goes through him as he reads the wall
of names.  Did they really kill
him, really?  for he has read
his own name among the honored dead.
A clerical mistake?  But to erase
those errors, far too high a cost
once that polished granite was embossed,
once the hero did not die, that is all,
officially.  No one will make redress.

So, do we honor living soldiers less?
or count them, because it might
have gone that way.  He, living still,
may wonder, does he, after all, belong
(for goodness sakes, he asks,
		questions, Is it right?)
Somehow he cannot let it go, it may be wrong
that he go on, have a job, a family, a wife
or any dutied loves that make a life.
