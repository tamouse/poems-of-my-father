title: "Triple S"
---

I lie upon this earth
possessed
by rock by swamp

I give my warmth
to this absorbing ground

I close on death
I dart

I put my body
into soil
in trust to water
loved by working air

I think of grapes
of yellow
bells
of leaves
I gather growths of stem
to myself

Left open
to a life I crave

a gasping flame
may eat the rain
I am not strong
or brave

Shaken from home
and bed all whimpering

wild wild
to stay
I can walk
one breath of time
solacing and deep

but I cannot decide
that I decide
that is a counsel
someone else must keep

A snake in triple S
writes my name
in script the flighted redowl
in gawping dives
through clouds
pretends
to read

to bring
to striding guardians
a thirteen striped
flapped parchment
to be signed
with
sticks
that bleed

to bring
to striding guardians
a thirteen striped
flapped parchment
to be signed
with
sticks
that bleed
