title: "See Your Face"
---

I do not  have to see your face I find
To know the loving magic of your smile
It is a radiance and its light is kind

Because your touch is soft,
                      has my soul signed,
Let me hold you closer, close a while.
I do  not have to see your face. I find

Each feature which my fingers have outlined
Comforting. Although the warmth is mild
It is a radiance and its light is kind.

Because your voice is full I could be blind
To that lost beauty and be reconciled--
I do not have to see your face.  I find

Your love of spirit leads for those behind
With goodly strength expecting no denial.
It is a radiance, and its light is kind.

Because the guided searching of your mind
Knows more than substance,
                works with more than style
I do not have to see you face. I find
It is a radiance and its light is kind.
