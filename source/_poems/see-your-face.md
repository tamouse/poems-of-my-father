title: "See Your Face"
---

I do not  have to see your face I find <br />
To know the loving magic of your smile <br />
It is a radiance and its light is kind <br />
 <br />
Because your touch is soft,  <br />
                      <span style="padding-left: 10em; ">has my soul signed,</span> <br />
Let me hold you closer, close a while. <br />
I do  not have to see your face. I find <br />
 <br />
Each feature which my fingers have outlined <br />
Comforting. Although the warmth is mild <br />
It is a radiance and its light is kind. <br />
 <br />
Because your voice is full I could be blind <br />
To that lost beauty and be reconciled-- <br />
I do not have to see your face.  I find <br />
 <br />
Your love of spirit leads for those behind <br />
With goodly strength expecting no denial. <br />
It is a radiance, and its light is kind. <br />
 <br />
Because the guided searching of your mind <br />
Knows more than substance,  <br />
                <span style="padding-left: 8em;">works with more than style</span> <br />
I do not have to see you face. I find <br />
It is a radiance and its light is kind. <br />
