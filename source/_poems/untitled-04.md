title: "Untitled (4)"

a watcher cannot tell
from near or far
what exactly is the shape of things:
a passing cloud can make the whole
affair
change pattern
while even close
one loose stone
may send him
limping home
Who knows
what rattler lurkng
innocent may end the day
Who says he knows the passage
must be assumng
what seems nearby is really there
though darkness looming
may be but a shadow
of the moment or the yawning
of a cavern ever barred
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
