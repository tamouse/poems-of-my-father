title: "Seasons Blend"
---

We ski on rhododendron petals spray
a snow of pink blue green as season blends
with season, overlay of days on day;
New Zealand Alps, Swiss Eucalyptus, trends
our dreams take, memories a cluttered drawer
disordered needing albums all about
a cubist near-clarity restore
sense with the photographs that you take out

what year it was this happened
        when was that
not nearly so important
as that now
what is adventurous
we may find new
and old at once
only a change of hat
or scarf to move
into what times allow
us: happy days
that we do and re-do
