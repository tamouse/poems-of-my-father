title: "Fred Lasher"
---

I stand by a bus stop
in my hometown.
On the bus a sign
DRIVEN BY FRED LASHER.
That couldn't be Fred Lasher,
dead for fifty years.
How could his name be there?

Fred Lasher wouldn't give his name
    to rules
to time to drive a bus
King Lasher and his round forty

I remember
because he wouldn't stay
inside the lines
the lines they draw
in Washington DC
to mark his borders
where to plant
where to cut his wood

Fred Lasher
had the sense
to cut the wood
where the wood was
just as he shot his deer
when deer were ready
not like the men who came

to play at hunting
in red hats
one week ten days
those lines drawn too
in Washington DC
to tell a man
where axes chop
when rifles shoot

Then startled
I remember when I am
why that's Fred Lasher's
grandson's used his name
I knew it all along
that couldn't be
Fred Lasher
