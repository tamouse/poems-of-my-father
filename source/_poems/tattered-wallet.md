title: "Tattered Wallet"
---

He took his tattered purse in hand,
the picture of his favorite nurse,
he did not see it land
upon the counter, understand
he does not see too well.  Soft curse
in ancient accents sharply terse
he utters, looking for a bill to pay
the grocer; then, to reverse
the lonely shaded way
to home...across the bridge
as added years disperse
his strength, until the last ride
which all others but rehearse.
