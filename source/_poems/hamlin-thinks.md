Hamlin thinks
of walking on the mountain

a hike is good
an exercise worthwhile

on many levels
find what flowers hide

among old rocks
changing elevation

comes with new varietlies

from his eastward window he can see
sunshine on the mountains It is a puzzle

light shapes here and dark tones
side by side
