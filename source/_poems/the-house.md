title: "The House"
---

The house I want to go to was torn down.
Just dumped you might say into its own pit
or cellar, not a decent basement quite.
A place to keep potatoes,  out of town
far enough that friends were scarce.
		One good friend
or two is all one needs, we tend
to gather far too many. Isn't it
a shame , such burden-building ...slight
acquaintances, now that's another matter;
good people all around, that is living right.

But friends, a person who can know about
what scared you when you were a little kid
just five, or so, before you learned to read
so you were victim to all sorts of scares: what did
the midnight ghost do, if he caught you? Shout
mean words at you.  Cause everything to end?
Gang up and depants you in the park?
Leave you in a cellar, cold and dark.

A friend, someone predictable enough
that if you need her, or him, say at noon
( it is so easy to be helpful after six,
at noon, is much more difficult). It's tough,
he says. Why sure, now, opportune,
it isn't."  Did you want to fix
your scooter,  or your bike?
what would you like?

A friend goes on beyond a simple task,
ready to try to help; no need to ask.
