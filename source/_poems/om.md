title: "Om"

to say a name
to say to say
a  name
until the word is something
more than name
the sound
the sound
repeating of that name
until the thing is found
that is the name

the word
unheard
the contemplated name
the call
the all in one
the toral name
the plea the sweet persuasive
signal name
but more
and more than any other
name
