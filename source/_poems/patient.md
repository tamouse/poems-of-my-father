title: "Patient"
---

He plunged to smash the window with his arm;
Not sense enough to put a chair through first
Or feared we'd be too fast with the alarm;
Whatever fears that drove him as he burst
Away from us, so meaningless my shout.
Cuts all over, slivers in him, screams inside;
Not pain, but that he needed to get out
So bad.  Three weeks we'd had him, as we tried
Good food, warm bed, new clothes. The only rips
Were those he made on purpose, knees exposed,
Other worked-on spots. No health-check strips,
No medicines or shocks, still he kept closed,
All tucked away, a meanness wrapped in sneers
Inside a bashful coyote look, a wary face
Too shy for talk and far too shy in years;
No hope, he had no present friend, no place.
We at the window, looking out and shocked,
Not that his fall had killed him, that he hung
Ten feet below us in the tree that mocked
Us as we swallowed hard, that stilled my tongue
With not a word worth saying--at a  loss--
Confused, I thought of Dali (Salvador)
His zenith view of Christ, the arms outspread.
He couldn't  move, hung there unconscious, or
He had no words. At least he wasn't dead.

They brought a cherry picker, up they rose,
"Hold still," they said--he was exactly still.
They couldn't put him out, there was a need
For some response, to have the kid awake,
Although he hung so quiet, person treed
Or crucified. But how much could he take?
At last they had him down, then quick a rinse
To soothe the skin and check for wood and glass;
The tiny bits still clinging, darks and glints
Came off and healing balms went on, the mess
All straightened out.
     Inside, what seemed far-fetched,
A resolute contentment on his face,
Epiphany or punishment, or stretched
Beyond resistance to some holy grace
