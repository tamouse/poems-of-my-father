title: "Patient"
---

He plunged to smash the window with his arm; <br />
Not sense enough to put a chair through first <br />
Or feared we'd be too fast with the alarm; <br />
Whatever fears that drove him as he burst <br />
Away from us, so meaningless my shout. <br />
Cuts all over, slivers in him, screams inside; <br />
Not pain, but that he needed to get out <br />
So bad.  Three weeks we'd had him, as we tried <br />
Good food, warm bed, new clothes. The only rips <br />
Were those he made on purpose, knees exposed, <br />
Other worked-on spots. No health-check strips, <br />
No medicines or shocks, still he kept closed, <br />
All tucked away, a meanness wrapped in sneers <br />
Inside a bashful coyote look, a wary face <br />
Too shy for talk and far too shy in years; <br />
No hope, he had no present friend, no place. <br />
We at the window, looking out and shocked, <br />
Not that his fall had killed him, that he hung <br />
Ten feet below us in the tree that mocked <br />
Us as we swallowed hard, that stilled my tongue <br />
With not a word worth saying--at a  loss-- <br />
Confused, I thought of Dali (Salvador) <br />
His zenith view of Christ, the arms outspread. <br />
He couldn't  move, hung there unconscious, or <br />
He had no words. At least he wasn't dead. <br />
 <br />
They brought a cherry picker, up they rose, <br />
"Hold still," they said--he was exactly still. <br />
They couldn't put him out, there was a need <br />
For some response, to have the kid awake, <br />
Although he hung so quiet, person treed <br />
Or crucified. But how much could he take? <br />
At last they had him down, then quick a rinse <br />
To soothe the skin and check for wood and glass; <br />
The tiny bits still clinging, darks and glints <br />
Came off and healing balms went on, the mess <br />
All straightened out. <br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">Inside, what seemed far-fetched,</span> <br />
A resolute contentment on his face, <br />
Epiphany or punishment, or stretched <br />
Beyond resistance to some holy grace <br />
