title: "Tour a Paris"
---

I'm writing to you from a far far country
beneath a giant arch with arches climbing
to cross-hatched girders trestles singing skyward
tourists lenses guidebooks rise a thousand feet
I've ridden  up again and while descending
A rebel patch of water draws my eye
from staring at the far-spread loving city
  I remember how you turned
		to watch two children
splashing in the duckpond shrieks and laughter
the unmown grasses holding mothers watching
again   I see them play and   I remember
how you marveled turning from this tower
for time to see this picture this reflection
this hidden water wild with ducks and splashes
I'm writing to you from a far far country
another autumn since we came together
discovering in one Parisian courtyard
a smiling lady old dressed all in black
she sat alone with two chairs
		one for bread crumbs
she coaxed some birds to eat.
		We stopped you counted
seven sparrows perched  upon one hand.
She busy did not notice that we noticed
how her lifetime focused on the feeding
to touch a wildness still within her reach.
Again I come remembering you counted
seven sparrows feeding on one hand
while others fluttered winging fussed. Somehow
she talked them into waiting   I am waiting.
