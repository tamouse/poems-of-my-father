title: Cold Season
---

Drifts of winter cover roof and window,
wolves surround to choir moonlit glory,
human in their hunger and their hunt.
Huddled where we are, inside dark snow rooms
frightened; we are their game; they are not ours.

Then summer, dark and burden melt
to tasks we fall to; we are ever healthy to that
with the sun building harvest
from our working and our dirt.

In joy we turn to waste all we have won
except at night the grey beasts watch
to howl us winter comes again.
