my home computer isn't working

oh it's working
it has some wires crossed

no, the wires are where they belong
but you see

I see,
that's a crosstalk problem
why we've had that
ever since the second telephone
was invented
you might say

you can fix it?

you need a crosstalk insulator

you have one?

oh not in stock

You can order one?

Let me check the catalog
I don't see
Oh, here
Only thirty-seven fifty

that will be great

they don't have them now
maybe when they re-tool
in the fall

then you cannot produce?

don't get huffy
what's the use

I  understand
but still
my lemonade
will be one quarter
melon juice

**II**

why don't you buy a new one
then you wouldn't be forever
patching, wiring, screwing
things together

there aren't any more
I can't afford it
the new ones can't be repaired
I'd be so poor  from buying new ones
every year a new one

everyone else has a new one

they are so poor from buying new ones
they can't go home at night
I can still go home at night
to eat a lemon
or a melon
I'm not sure which
the home computer
has some wires crossed

you still should buy a new one
or not come around here any more

they're out of new ones

they picked up your old one
someone took it home
to make a lamp out of it

then I'll go home
to eat a lemon
or a melon
