Keats looked at a Grecian urn
and thought about the figures on it
--human figures doing a lovely thing--
Michelangelo has the same sort of moment
painted on a ceiling
only it is man and God
doing a lovely thing--
both have a moment of
portent turned into everlastingness--

so if I paint even a thought or a wisp
of color on a page

I will be thinking
of all other paintings
putting my painting
in a line of succession
that the Cloudy Curator
will catalog
because that is his job

and for a moment
find Himself
grateful
or not
