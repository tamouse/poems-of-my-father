title: "Forgetting"
---

The places I remember far away
The places I remember that are near
All memories I lose each passing day

What was that lighted town, a bright display
Sky-high, it was? or so it did appear.
The places I remember far away

Where was that town they couldn't let us stay
They had a festival tat time of year.
All memories I lose each passing day

Who was that friend who taught us how to say
the foreign phrases we found so hard to hear.
The places I remember far away

A frame with  nothing in it, gone what may
More than regret, the emptying I fear
All memories I lose each passing day

I want back all that brightness gone to grey
Whole reaches of a life no longer clear.
The places I remember far away
All memories I lose each passing day
