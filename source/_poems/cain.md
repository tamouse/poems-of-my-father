If that blunt shovel hadn't been so right,
so fitted to the swing; as if I needed that.
I hadn't thought his head would be so soft.
The red life running out of him, out of him,
in all ways going deeper, deeper.
All the questions, all the bother.
Well let me ask a question:
who really is my father?
Let me ask another question:
am I my brother's keeper?
