title: "Seeker"
---

A seeker after old things has descended
one hundred thousand years beneath his time.
Long chipping rock to sand-sized pieces
		gives him
one tiny pointing bone he rests. The grime
and sweat have made a mask of mud.
He's worked all day.
He well deserves a moment's calm.
Once rock was clay
once clay was flesh. The time reverses:
two are kneeling palm to palm.
The question, yes, the eon-welding  question
between these two explorers must arise,
but how to choose the words
		not spoil the moment
before this crack in time be closed.
		He tries, he tries.

The question long in waiting:
		have they painted yet
the antlered deer to seem alive
and leaping on our wall that magic
will bring food so we survive?
We do survive?
