title: "Song for Shepherds"
---

How could she have known that in the days
before his birth the stars converged to grow
a brightness meant to let some shepherds know
what stars were doing: concentrating rays
as but symbolic for a larger phase
of new ideas knotting  to let glow
(historical significance) to throw
life's meaning backward with a craze
for taking god so bloody big in ways
that numbed the brain -- that thwarted mental flow --
imagined god above and life below.
The separation crosses and betrays
the hope of once discovering the tie:
the 'one' of grass-plain ground with clear blue sky
