title: "Jade Carving Three"
---

A palace of rocks, the sun-storm wind
Has swept the resting valley clear.
Life fights  for holds at timberline;

The soil around the small roots thinned.
The harvest age of the mountain year
Continues with work of birch and pine.

Here is the home, the private place,
We pause by the woodsman andwe hear
His echoed song fromt he tall rock face.
