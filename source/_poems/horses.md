title: "Horses"
---

We took the horses with us for the grass
so they could pasture there and roll
on level grassy ground. They like to rub
a working back against a smoother field--
all stones and rubble where we are--
no place to lay a body on the earth
play with this rolfing planet for a while.

Imagine horses rolling fast downhill
their legs tucked up, their necks out-stretched,
a spin of such unpardonable joy.

The horse would never stand to walk again.
As much as man has problems with his build,
A horse has more and even without sport
Can get a twisted gut that kills.
                  You have
to slide your hand up into him and slow
move up and straighten as you go, your hand
salvation if you do it right, except
the sick and frightened animal won't know
what you are up to and may give a kick
to send you for a sprawl.  That twisted gut
is common, not a rare form for a death

A head-on run downwind is sport enough.
a horse can go short distances at speed
that flies your hair, can spray his voice
across a prairie, let it know someone
is coming, something's up.
                  For friendship's sake--
I didn't let that notion in too soon--
we took the horses with us for the grass.
