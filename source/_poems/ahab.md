title: "Ahab"
---

born to have lain
in cold
and listening swamp
native
with lily and frog
settling in water and dirt
swamp in eyes ears nose on skin
shivering limited warmth
into unlimited cold

coyote lonely
catching the odor of quail
the sweet blood-smell of partridge
across directionless
frozen trails
sweeps of vision
sleeping in cold
such was the world
understood
as a child

driven
on winds and currents
across strong wills
driven outward
drifting inward
to have his own
direction
