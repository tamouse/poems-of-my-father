title: "Waited"
---

We waited such a long time for your call
We jumped each time the senseless phone
		would ring
Each car door slamming was another wall

Of time built up around us--time to crawl
Through hours till morning--frightened
		time to  cling
We waited such a long time for your call

We held our breath and heard small
		sounds grow tall
We wondered what the next mail truck
		might bring
Each car door slamming was another wall

The sirens wailing were the worst of all
The come-and-go: a child's gone-crazy swing
We waited such a long time for your call

How heavy silence is in its slow fall
How long life is when measured by its sting
Each car door slamming was another wall

Those sirens with that manic high-pitched bawl
What can they mean in memory anything?
We waited such a long time for your call
Each car door slamming was another wall
