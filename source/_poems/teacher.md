title: "Teacher"
---

if she had words enough and time
she'd reach the feelings and the mind
of those who seek to  grow and climb
beyond the world where they're confined

not that her world has further scope
not that her world has gentler clime
but that she hoped or had seen that hope
give shape to what was else resigned
when to the struggle darkenss yields
in what was meant  to be sublime
