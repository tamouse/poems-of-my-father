title: "Trite on Rye"

Everything I need is in the river.
The people playing on the cliff above
will fall and I will save them, be a saver --
is that a role I can be worthy of?

Hoping they will listen, come to borrow,
use what has been harvested from years.
Hold them, let them pay all back tomorrow
once the cloud of cold confusion clears
