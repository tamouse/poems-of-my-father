layout: poem
title: "Cows Come Home"
---

the shoe is stained
the jacket torn
the fingers aging into statue

a church tune
nasals in his head
having lost crescendo droning

he beats his hands together
stammering a pitiful condition
begging: cuppa cuppa

unless one listens back
thirty years to hear the lost crescendo
he claps his hands to drive the dog

cuppa cuppa .. cuh baw  cuh baw
"come boss, come boss"
in words as old as languages
old beyond all parthenons
