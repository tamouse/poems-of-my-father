loons cry
across flat swamp
and in my heart

virgin coral forest
upwells, nourishes
inner city hood

plant the brick
next to the other brick
room between for grass

step on my body
prone to punishment
pressed to earth

shift down
grind metal teeth
spit gravel
at the past


knee thigh
warm new
already taken
