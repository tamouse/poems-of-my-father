The only family I have
is my first-born son, Christian.
Thirteen now and he and I
have been together four years.
His mother lives
a thousand miles from here
along with our two other sons
ten and eight.
If Christian will talk to me
like he used to
it's worth it all
my childhood of bouncing around
from one place to another
worth it if he will talk to me

One person can be so much to you
even your own kid
if it's the only family you have
When they stole our Atari ST
he just shut up
I hardly see him now except meals
He opens his mouth to eat

Maybe he knows I set up the thefts
to collect both ends,
steal the piece then have it stolen.

He's a smart kid.
He must have figured out
all the thefts we've had by now.
His mother will get him...
I'll never get him back
two years from now
when I get out.

Try talking to a thirteen-year-old
about two years.
Everybody thinks a hole of two years
out of my  life
will leave me better.
