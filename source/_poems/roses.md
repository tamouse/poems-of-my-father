title: "Roses"
---

I loved the child with roses in her hair
she wove with vine and petals hummed a strain
and danced. The morning wonderfully fair

was warm with her and bright. Beside my chair
she left some clustered blooms. Through unknown  pain
I loved the child with roses in her hair.

A garden princess, could a thorn be there?
A royal presence certain of her reign
who danced the morning wonderfully fair,

exquisitely light with sunbeams everywhere.
That moment was the height I could attain.
I loved the child with roses in her hair.

As on her blushing cheek she charmed the air
with song and twirling a rose chain
she danced the morning wonderfully fair.

I did not know then I could not repair
a missing step that she could not explain.
I loved the child with roses in her hair
who danced the morning wonderfully fair.
