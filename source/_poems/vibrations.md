title: "Vibrations"
---

Vibrations all around us live and strong
we were the ones who heard and kept the beat
with rhythms of the hopes the words repeat
a lifetime and each moment capped with song
if in the day to day the words went wrong
we found comfort in the music we heard sweet
but that unheard was...
		something penned by Keats
with harmonies we have remembered long

Publicly the wonder of the seeds
speak to a world in paradigm
in metaphor of how things ought to be
privately we share our secret needs
so when the massive echoes of the hymn
have faded; Piper, pipe a song for me.
