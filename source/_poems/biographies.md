some days by morning burn off their strong haze
so early all their hangfire gold be gone
some blandly blue on blue end as they start
know little or nothing of wave or flame
cold sleeted skies as cold as gray on gray
or may yet serve a sunrise bright as down
a few bear storms that tear the land apart
leaving it never again the same

to draw a sixteenth century parachute
concentric sun waves or a starry night
or learn to win through those who persecute
or span the universe in mental flight

so do the great ones more great ones succeed
a lifetime of bright days on days to read
