title: "Wild Child"
---

We found by chance your hiding place,
We saw the bright light of your skin
Scared, dirty face.;
Saw through your eyes,
Within,
That what had left you savage, kept you wise.

We couldn't leave you well alone
For what kind care or tenderness
Could you have known?
You scratched and bit,
A mess.
We held you in my coat, you had a fit.

We taught, retaught, you passed no test,
Although you were no common boy;
You had expressed
With silent mouth
The joy
That rapt you when the wind was from the south.

Or, when the moon had grown to full,
You drank that light as it were fire
Your strength could pull
From cold night air.
Inspired,
I stood and watched the moonlight in your hair.

One night, next to the window, barred,
You stood between the curtains, drawn.
The sky, ill-starred;
I heard you sing
What dawn
Might sing: you listened to uncommon things

You gathered darkness in your arms,
Your movements quick and light as birds
With forest charms
To judge us by:
No words,
Voiced images in language we can't cry.

Nothing of success, we let you wait
The wearing years out, out of view.
Ward of the state,
You broke your cage
And flew
At thirty-three -- odd number, mystic age.
