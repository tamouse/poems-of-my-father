i

Damn
the  piteous
here,
not in Hell
yet
part of it.
The man,
frame
for the mind,
the body,
bone and blood:
machine cold,
blind,
which thoughts
like flames
unquenchable
compel
into the garden
no one
could foretell.
To find
a faulted
mattered
undefined
and undefinable
universe behind
this stage,
where people
clambered down
or fell;
quarreling on one event
absurd
unknowable,
chasing
after a fashion
debating
to abstract
what might be
the first
yes
as well
the last
word;
too late
to wonder
if
the world
meant
to lose
these values
of the lives
it spent.

When
will the flames
stop licking.

Each
of my rooms
is warm
on the wall.

The blistering paint
of my table
falls
in flecks
on the floor.
Little tongues
are flicking.
I dare not open any doors.

Through the frame
on my window
the Flowers
watch
eye to my eye;
the Niobe
counting hours
of my garden,
no longer --
my Danish maiden --
cries
to the sky-touching towers
of the city
as flames
from the edge
of my paper
upreaching and roaring
devour.

iii

In San Francisco's
velvet red
and bronze
east and west
re-echoing
back rooms,

grey shadows
play
on smoke
the wine
exhumes.

In hotel
indoor plantings
green with fronds

half hiding
metal cranes
in fountained
ponds

together cloak
crowd music
reaching blooms
that all the city --
harbored park --
assumes
a permanent
'perhaps'
for vagabonds.

Man
gripping
delicate and crude
is purpose
error
joke
or interlude,
tasting
nourish
or choke
on sweet or sour,

developing
each century
an hour.

Garden to garden
travels
all the while
losing substance,
hoping yet
for style

iv

hammering
hammering
a box
least
of common shelters
as against
a glow
I shut my eyes
to watch
my own blood flow.
Here  learn
that as awarenesses
increased,
we're blessed
alone
by that which we have blessed.

No one
to help
or hold for us
the cup,
at least
we must
do our own
growing up.

Fallen
piteous
where we failed
that test.
Dark,
the feel of dark,
the smell,
cold ash.
The spent-match odor
one by one
gone
cold
the body still
no movement
none;

no breath, no touch,
no tiny flash,
all done.

Small,
no space,
no light,
no heat,
then
to flame;
hot,  hot,
pain, pain,
each nerve end
slash.
