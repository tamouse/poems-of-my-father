title: "Work"
---

work they tell us
on the roadway
bring pick and shovel
lunch sweatbands
for the head
get there
no foreman
no gang
no work
the roadway all done
white lines painted
signs up
traffic going by
we stand around
we swing a pick
a rock clatters
to the river
we whoop lope
we chase crayfish
waer bonecold
walk home
we had expected work
brough pick and shovel
lunch
fine doings
none of us
was going
anywhere
