title: "Nineteen Sixty-eight"
---

The comfort of the kids
who took to streets,
brave hearts on tattered sleeves,
for bringing Prufrock
from obtuse to obvious, grieves
these added years;
their green words failing
after a rainless season
in this mid-summer orchard
with October leaves.

Foolish were they
in the cruel but flowered
April of their year.
neglecting the unnamed orphan
who longed for life,
only to call her back now
bedded but not embraced
to be a barefoot wife
holding in compact purposes
a homemade pruning knife.

So must the young years grieve,
not so much for the tattered
of heart, not for the undreamed child,
as for her -- call her Winged Victory,
a dream of ancient heroines
where now and then she smiled;
not now beautiful,
see her the waif-wife
barren and wasted
as if once more exiled.

Tenderness new
not a recradled couple
with lovesong of the mime,
for no half measured serenades
endear or charm,
a stronger hold belongs
in this harsh time:
enfold both fear and faith
as from opposing prime
she young to you yields
in your now newly ageless arms.
