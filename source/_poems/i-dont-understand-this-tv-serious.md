title: "I Don't Understand This TV Serious"

(Rhythms for a gynocologist)

he sure the parents are advised: some scenes
may not be suitable. before this birth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.

we very likely will offend some deans.
who knows what unintended flicks are worth?
be sure the parents are advised.  Some scenes

will catch them unprepared: the teens,
for instance; dangerous, although their mirth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.

To wait. to wait, late hours in front of screens
that flicker nonsense of commercial dearth.
Be sure the parents are advised: some scenes

the young adults: child-like in jeans
can have them tossing. An uneasy berth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.

To try to help them suffer the machines
the cluttered lights and shadows of this earth,
be sure the parents are advised: some  scenes
can overwhelm them with what one life means.
