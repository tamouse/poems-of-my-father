title: "Words to a Plant"
---

How have  you been,
Greensleeves
You've had water, old Barkfingers,
Good soil around your roots,
well-potted, Sun-Reacher.

Time, blush, to flower
maybe seeds, huh?
I'll bring a butterfly
or a bee, Twig-Rustler.

This spring, I'll see to it
that you have a nest,
not a robin's nest,
built in a week, a throw-away.
Oh, no, an oriole's nest,
that marvel of a purse they weave.
I'll get you one, if I have to go
without theater tickets,
or give up ice-cream like for Lent.
A guy needs a friend
and Plant, with your second flower
if it comes I'll make tea
a superb infusion to drink
wth carckers from London
with cheese from Finland,
and upon the window.
