Why never in our passing do we talk
about a feeling or important thought
good morning is enough or how you are
followed by a meaningless just fine
I see in your east window blush to see
so turn away I must not let you know

that I have spied not even though we know
your private action could not cause the talk
that would embarrass it's all right to see
you washing dishes, what  a silly thought
that watching you at tasks is not a fine
allowed discovery of what you are

to that extent, so later, when we are
both workng in the yard, I say you know
these irises of mine would look so fine
if some were spread in your yard, idle talk
but carefully disguising any thought
that your life might be something I should see

I bring a picture over so you see
how shyly delicate the colors are
in answer to my statement that's a thought
you calmly say as if you did not know
some hope of recognition in your talk
behind my try them they will do just fine

is not of flowers only, waving fine
and waiting for a blossom season: see
such blue and white.. I would do more than talk
for in your eyes how haunting colors are
perhaps not loving, admiration, know
that you are lovely--just a thought.

So when you bring a chair you say  you thought
that I might fix yes, glue will make it fine
as good as new, but wait, how did you know
I do such things you tell me you can see
through my west basement window how there are
my piled up projects so we laugh more talk.

With one thought leading to another, may we see
that  getting close we know share trust, talk
Fantastic are romances we refine.
