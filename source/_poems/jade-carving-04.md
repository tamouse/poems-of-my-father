title: "Jade Carving Four"
---

A palace of rocks an cordwood piled
High for the seasoned to be shipped.
A working sun rides hot and brihgt

High is best for life in the wild,
Bare were rock and snow have lsipped
Cutting a path to the hard-won height.

Where man must ever live out-guest
Below the highest rock wind-stripped,
Where cold clear green arrives refreshed.
