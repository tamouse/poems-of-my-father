title: "Clay Pot"
---

<p>    Where will we be
    my friends,
    when someone tells us
    that if we are more than
    ordinarily
    	intelligent
    	lucky
    	devoted
    	good with our hands
    we may
    within a lifetime
    produce a pot
    as good as a thousand pots
    buried
    under ten thousand years
    of village dust.
</p>
