DISCLAIMER                                           

Question my meaning no more than to ask
of the gambler what is gaming, or inquire
of the tree why eastward leaning,
of the flying fish its task,
or what of light and painful flaming 
of the fire.


BIKING BACKWARDS

The paperboy rides backwards on his bike.
Discreetly kindly neighbors play their part
and watch through curtains in this world of tact.
The trick is to pretend there is no trick.

Introspective, retrospective, slick,
the skills confusing simple front and back.
The art is to pretend there is no art
whatever form of craft or skill we pick.

The paperboy will visit at our place
to talk a little of what news he brings.
He pedals off, the smile upon his face
toward me, as if I were at home a king.

He's riding backwards, turns to look ahead,
uncommon skill to see what will have led.


2                    ROSES                            
                              

I loved the child with roses in her hair
she wove with vine and petals hummed a strain
and danced. The morning wonderfully fair

was warm with her and bright. Beside my chair
she left some clustered blooms. Through unknown  pain
I loved the child with roses in her hair.

A garden princess, could a thorn be there?
A royal presence certain of her reign
who danced the morning wonderfully fair,

exquisitely light with sunbeams everywhere.
That moment was the height I could attain.
I loved the child with roses in her hair.

As on her blushing cheek she charmed the air
with song and twirling a rose chain
she danced the morning wonderfully fair.

I did not know then I could not repair
a missing step that she could not explain.
I loved the child with roses in her hair
who danced the morning wonderfully fair.

SEE YOUR FACE                                         

I do not  have to see your face I find
To know the loving magic of your smile
It is a radiance and its light is kind

Because your touch is soft, 
                       has my soul signed,
Let me hold you closer, close a while.
I do  not have to see your face. I find

Each feature which my fingers have outlined
Comforting. Although the warmth is mild
It is a radiance and its light is kind.

Because your voice is full I could be blind
To that lost beauty and be reconciled--
I do not have to see your face.  I find

Your love of spirit leads for those behind
With goodly strength expecting no denial.
It is a radiance, and its light is kind.

Because the guided searching of your mind
Knows more than substance, 
                works with more than style
I do not have to see you face. I find
It is a radiance and its light is kind.

 ARTISITC CIRCLES                 

He painted gray,
dark gray and light,
enjoyed the play
of day and night
through black to white.
He liked the way                 
the line of sight
refused to stay
in place; a flight
of sheer delight.

He found a clay
he thought he might
by adding, lay
down surprise, slight
but somehow right,
a touch of red
the fighting shade
seemed to have bled
a darker grade
to life and stayed.
	He added blue
almost afraid
as something true
seemed to persuade
the dark to fade.
A middle green

5

a value new
an earthy sheen
enriched  and grew
past what he knew.
He painted more                                       
than he could plan
beyond the store
of well-taught man.
The color ran,
a million hues,
no limit here,
no need to choose.
The whole true sphere
could now appear.
It is too much,
a self-declared
fantastic touch
of godhead glared
past what he dared.
An emptiness                  
with no control
may best express
the human soul
in its long role,
yet choose one must
and borders make.
He did not trust,
indeed called fake.
the steps we take.
All his work blended,
what can one say,

his efforts ended
as tray by tray
he painted grey.
         
PATIENT                                               

He plunged to smash the window with his arm;
Not sense enough to put a chair through first
Or feared we'd be too fast with the alarm;
Whatever fears that drove him as he burst
Away from us, so meaningless my shout.
Cuts all over, slivers in him, screams inside;
Not pain, but that he needed to get out
So bad.  Three weeks we'd had him, as we tried
Good food, warm bed, new clothes. The only rips
Were those he made on purpose, knees exposed,
Other worked-on spots. No health-check strips,
No medicines or shocks, still he kept closed,
All tucked away, a meanness wrapped in sneers
Inside a bashful coyote look, a wary face
Too shy for talk and far too shy in years;
No hope, he had no present friend, no place.
We at the window, looking out and shocked,
Not that his fall had killed him, that he hung
Ten feet below us in the tree that mocked
Us as we swallowed hard, that stilled my tongue
With not a word worth saying--at a  loss--
Confused, I thought of Dali (Salvador)
His zenith view of Christ, the arms outspread.
He couldn't  move, hung there unconscious, or
He had no words. At least he wasn't dead.

7
They brought a cherry picker, up they rose,
"Hold still," they said--he was exactly still.
They couldn't put him out, there was a need
For some response, to have the kid awake,
Although he hung so quiet, person treed
Or crucified. But how much could he take?
At last they had him down, then quick a rinse
To soothe the skin and check for wood and glass;
The tiny bits still clinging, darks and glints
Came off and healing balms went on, the mess
All straightened out.                    
       Inside, what seemed far-fetched,   
A resolute contentment on his face,
Epiphany or punishment, or stretched
Beyond resistance to some holy grace                  
  
 PRINCES

ALEXANDRINE                                   
In London  a museum, tourists in the hall
where marble men and horses 
		march along each wall.
The flesh forms echo hills of Greece 
		their ancient source
I'm not sure which one suffers more 
		the man or horse.
I hear the clank, I smell the dust, I feel alone;
here where what's most alive is carved in stone.
My own campaigns have been preparing fields
		for seeding.
A boy with a boy's horse 
		that often did the leading.
So strong though near his end;
                        we have him for that reason,
reliable good natured safe. In one cold season
his final walk to pasture fails, his only fall.
I hear my father working in the barn. I call
Pa, the  horse is down Pa, something's wrong.
Here, take this five-tined fork inside 
		now go along
I take the fork but stay?You'll watch?
              	Pa, I don't know.
I watch. The giant legs write arcs on 				sleigh-packed snow.
A crow calls once, I point the fork, 
		mock rifle, at the tree.
The black one waits. He thinks I clown, 
		or does not  see.


10
I javelin the fork as he disdains reply.
Tines twang on ice, the crow waits still. 
		The metal  cries.
It hurts to die, Pa? Well, he dreams 
		he logs old trails.
Or brings in loads of hay, Pa?
                     Sunshine in the bales.
Or like a colt again, Pa?
                     Prancing in new light.
Reliving  all those years, Pa?
                    Now, that may be right.
The death of this old horse 
		can surely have no wrong.
Long seasons he has worked to die 
		where he belongs.
He is not hurried off to battle there to wonder
at fading light new pain 
		and feeling man-made thunder,
red bubbles in the nose, hard breathing, 
		belly spilling,
unloved yet naked to obedience and willing,
like boys eighteen who although dressed 
		to soldier far
must question, turning cold alone, 
		where is the star.
His feet aren't moving, Pa. We bury him?
Well, no, that only makes the failing processes 		go slow.




11
We'll skid him like a log to brush 
		where  he'll be laid.
Perhaps we'll stumble on clean bones 
		in August shade. 
Come home to supper.  It's all easier 
		when you're old.
Come home, come home. 
Don't just stand there, boy.    
                       It's cold.

AT THE ART INSTITUTE                                   

imagined worlds 
more real than any other
a group child stands beside me
empty-eyed sees nothing

where are those who brought him
something to do on a rainy day
but so careless they have lost him

in the next room 
blocks of color wisps of wonder
all this world of warm
to me is cold unmade discovery
as when
I first read poems by Baudelaire
Drooling beside me the group child
has become my brother
mon semblable  mon frère

THE LITTLE MERMAID                        

An act of vandalism was the cutting off
of the head of the Little Mermaid statue
in Copenhagen harbor.  .
-------------------------------------
Silences and waiting times so long
And never knowing was it sea or land
I was to watch.  Still with no words, no song,
The world confused, the world to understand.

Born in a myth by sailors out of place,
Born by a mist, longing, what would they see:
A baby seal, enchanting eyes, loved face;
From image of strong wives this came to be.

When men first told the tale, we could exult:
A hope of innocence set on this coast
In metal form for tourists. The result:
Neglect where grey-white gull wings 
		touch the most.

So stories grow or lie on dormant shelves
Until men once again research themselves.

(I dreamed once I could neither see nor hear
But like a wounded beast crawled off to die;
Yet could not die; a legend turned to fear;
A wingless gull that feeds but cannot fly.)

13
When working men go by on lonesome ways     
To face long fishing months, 
		they meet these eyes;
They stare, renewing thoughts 
		of homebound days
With open sea-trust we both recognize.
When sea-born spirits visit here and dance,
The very surface dances too. Here flocks
Of gathered high-flown birds descend, entránce
The air. They clamor whitely on dark rocks.

Three men by boat -- what they were thinking of
Was never wave-born, never myth, nor love.

The head, the sawing off, took half the night.
Pain in this metal state is hard to shape.
A cringing rasp, a grate, in star-cold light;
Decisions out of limits learned from rape.
Lovely the head, reflection sank, dissolved;
Above, whirlpooling oars creaked 	
		round on round.
Mere vehicles of water merged, revolved;
Seeking the cry, yet sightless, could not sound,

False dawn awoke the wraiths 
		who slept off shore.
They trailed among the rocks and reminisced
As mourners, listened, searched, 
		but found no  more
Since all was phantom here, sheer mist in mist.
This blew away... so world again... except
Soft  daylight glinted bleeding where it crept

 TODD

The face that waited many years is gone.
As I came home from school,I turned the corner
Saw the face before those eyes saw me;
I got to see the searching look, to see
The sad expression turn into a grin
Because when I got home his day began.
That face was what would bring me 	
		home instead
Of staying in for sports or other things;
My older brother's face, he was sixteen
Which made him four years older than I was
But he much smaller. I remember when
We went on walks together; he would tell
All sorts of stuff about what grows in woods;
The mushrooms, hidden things you dig for, not
Just showy plants, and he could hear the change
Of silences in wind, of songs of birds,
and he could walk then, with a little help.
I was the one could understand his speech--
He jabbered all the time--his drooling way
That  bothered others, even mother. That 
Got worse,and when I came in through the door
His shirt was wet from happiness, so off
It came, the first thing after I got home.
I wiped him dry and got a fresh one. Then 
The diaper--Dad said would I help Mom--
That business would help her out so much
If I would do just that.  I did much more...
I helped him eat, play games.  He drooled
More when I helped him; he did that to show

	15

How much he likes attention.
                        Oh, my name
Is Tracy although I'm a boy. Do I get teased!
Mom says they like you 
		when they tease so much.
As my big brother needed me, we went
From one place to another, and we spent
So many hours at the window. Sit and look out
He said, so much to see from just one spot.
He told me once about a book he read
About somebody playing catcher... played
Out in an oatfield.  Todd said he would like
To play like that and when I had more time
When I was older a few years, he said
That I should read that book. I guess I will.

That brother that I had would have been great
As catcher had he lived for he was brave.
I guess that's what I want to be, for I
Am brave... at least I will be, for my  dad
He is a fireman, he saves lives.

                       Now, that 
Makes two besides my mother who are brave.
About the oatfield, I don't understand,
And grampa says it's outfield; if you know
The least thing about baseball... must be right
My grampa's never wrong. and Todd, he had
A reason that he wanted me to read
That book... it still is there... I will some day.

 POWERS                                       

The spruce root curled
around the edge of a cliff
where the water fell  fifty feet
the least tip of a least root
-- Parenthesis. She took her pen
writing how she felt,
water, sound, power,
lace of spray,
persistence  of the flower
stuck to the same rock edge.
The bird too close to her,
she sat so still except for the pen
-- end parenthesis --
and split the rock.


MEADOW FLOWER

What may I bring you
      of a greater worth
Than stranded weeds 
     from unclaimed plots of earth.
They are the promise
     first love could express:
First woman in my life
    who gave me life said yes
To these in a most charming way.

                                                   

          17

What may I bring you
     you could treasure more
If these were once 
    what could not pleasure more.
Let common days like common blooms
    find us as plain in heart; hum-drum,
As ordinary
    as a new day's start; come
What may.

 GRANDDAUGHTER	  

Spinning in cloth of wonder child I grow
with; backyard swingset, sandpile, garden, tree,
Our bench. We sit, hear humming one slow bee;
So deep in profuse clover can it know
How strung to threadbare land and sky we go,
Ragged together, hemming sand to sea,
Spider to tailor; nothing free or free
To lose for all things lend as all things owe.

Warm blanket life, each child unknowing wraps
Near perfect patterns we all have, but one
By one fall tangled years. A dream perhaps
That only children know: the world is spun.
Granddaughter, young enough to understand
That we reach upward for a loving hand

 GEESE                                                
 	 a sestina
		
Geese on the church lawn, what a change.
Time was they were so scarce, lived all alone
On forest lakes. One lake would have one pair,
Who chased off ducks and other geese. 
		Now, look,
They crowd on sidewalks, eat; 
		they stand and stare
Like turkeys (tame ones).  As they study us

On Sunday mornings, do they challenge us?
We hurry in through doors that do not change,
From week to week, from age to age: the stare
Of saints and cherubim, who keep a lone
And silent vigil, that kind patient look.
They say those birds, on bonding, make a pair

For life, and loss of one must leave despair
Behind: complex, the lesson there for us,
Deserving of a wise and second look.
How can we cause within ourselves a change
In our long habits. We can't live alone,
Too many though, we soon breathe our last air.

That goose, a broken wing.  The children stare
With sorrow, watch the other of that pair
Stay with its mate who can't be left alone.
Forbidden flight; what is in this for us?
For surely inborn thoughts allow a change.
The children wonder, tearful as they look.
          19

Now, time to vee up, that sky has a look
Of winter in it, no time left to stare.
The geese sense colder weather, move to change.
The broken-wing one,  gone; loss we compare
To funeral.  The whole flock leaving us
Their honks great primal words we hear alone.

We feel the richer, left behind alone,
A temporary leaving, desert look;
Church maintenance concern enough for us.
One morning, one by one, the children stare
With, See! Surprise! Here comes 
		the crippled pair.
They waddle toward our help, our care, 
		our change.

A task for us, to feed,  keep warm.  A pair
Of orphans come to stare. A sorry look,
These birds alone may help us to our change.

MA                                                    
  

I remember her mopping the floor
after some dire accident probably
caused by me and  I asked 'do you 
love me' and she could only shrug.
I remember telling her one morning 
we had stayed at Hartman's that my
new pants were terrible.  She was
so disappointed that I didn't like them
until I explained that they could be
torn and were therefore tearible.

She repeated this to Miss Hartman.
I remember coming home with a
paper with colored dots and telling
Ma it was a secret club I had joined.
She told me not to have anything to
do with anyone who said  I should
not tell her about something.
I remember her smiling as part of the
audience watching me in the 
kindergarten play about the toys that
came to life when the shopkeeper
left.   I was the shopkeeper.

I remember wondering what she 
would say, but I don't remember what 
she DID say, when I broke my new
	21

pencil box with the sliding roll-up 
cover over the head of another kid.
I remember she found bugs in the
flour drawer.
I remember being underfoot in
the kitchen playing with the butter
boxes with Janice.
I remember her seeing the wren 
when it returned for another summer
in the nest by the kitchen window.
I remember her teaching me the 
child's prayer about dying before I 
wake... and not being too frightened.
(As Huck Finn would have said "If she 
can stand it, I can."

I remember her worn shoes and  the corns.
I remember her taking care of us when
we were lined up on the floor taking
turns throwing up from the flu
and how it took me a long time
to like baloney after that.
I remember joining Janice in
wailing about how awful the string
beans were.
I remember the chocolate drops
she brought home from town.
The biggest sack of candy to be found



22  
 ROOM FOR JOSEPH           

Oh, yes, there were those voices in the air,
The tidings brought to Mary. What I heard
"Joseph, be content," seemed so unfair;
That I was not a whole man is absurd.

As smooth as any shank planed slick as skin
We fitted, in our sleeping, front to back
Or snug as mortised tenon, fitted in.
Go ask her, ask her, was there ever lack

Of manhood in me? Look, this chair, the grain
Curls up this leg just right. See that? And who
Found wood and let the shape of nature's wain
Become this resting curve, each turning true?

How is it then that I can be declared
Unfit, unlikely, or what words they chose,
As if my honored lineage were impaired
By noble age? That is what they suppose.

Oh, such a son we had!  When he was three
He asked, "What do you do with all these tools?"
He looked at backsaws, draw knives, chisels... 		free
And open with his questions.  How the fools
Who heard him laughed. Then questions grew 		too big.

23
"Was sharpness not the main part of my  trade?"
Or, "Was the tightness of the fitted jig
Set on the best wood how the best man made

The best frame?"  Questionings until I lost
The sense, sometimes. His mind jumped so. 			"Don't use
Old wood for a new crib... for that can cost
You time and work with what good will you lose."

 We two, we peeled the bark, we squared  
		the stock...
It's so much fun to work with your own kid.
We talked together as we planed a block;
How beauty rose inside the work we did

From deep within the wood.  "Had something 		planned
That pattern, put it in for us to find
Truth there?"  I said, "You've got to understand:
Thoughts must be smaller, or we lose our mind."

But it was not his mind they took.  The hour
He heard me, and could simplify each thought,
So much a miracle,that gave him power
To focus wonder.  Then they came and caught

Him, hated him and found ways to destroy.
One simple answer:  "Look for a good life
And worry what 'good' is."  He is my boy.
They can't change that.  His mother is my wife.

COLD SEASON
      
Drifts of winter cover roof and window,
wolves surround to choir moonlit glory,
human in their hunger and their hunt.
Huddled where we are, inside dark snow rooms
frightened; we are their game; they are not ours.

Then summer, dark and burden melt 
to tasks we fall to; we are ever healthy to that
with the sun building harvest
from our working and our dirt.

In joy we turn to waste all we have won
except at night the grey beasts watch
to howl us winter comes again.

 PLANTING

 I live within a garden not my own,
Yet mine to care for, see it grow and feed
My nature as I tend it, flower and weed
The same.  Upon this path I place a foot
To visit cabbages and thistles grown
Precisely here, to know them head and root,
To hear that rain has washed, feel sun has shone.
I walk a nursing ground where I can put
Myself to find a soil for flesh and bone.




25

 WINTER
 
It snowed and snowed
on city park
and street. Hills glowed
through fingered bark,
grays blurred on white.
Our window showed
the longest night
not really dark.
When you were down,
ill, color gone,
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets stamped to stone
we skated on.

   PAINTER AND HIS MODEL     

At first her gaze of love was but pretense.
Had she intended only to adore
An outward version of me, not the core
Where passions melt the bedrock of events
Where dreaming shapes reshapes to private sense
Then I had not been changed, and change before
All other forces will occur the more
I do of any present consequence.

So surface quality of this affair
Was not her way -- my brushes made a scene
That, while increasingly aware
Of what my pencils drew, I drew. Embraced
By deeper care, to me she came to mean
The landscape, foreground, action of my space.

VALENTINE

Remember how they came 
to see the studio
we built
to marvel
at the mobiles
we had hung
from rafters
where you worked
with threads
that in and out
caught patterns
you had found
past curtained landscapes
while I tried
to make the words 
be patterns too.

( None of this happened )

We never bought a barn
but had the brave adventure
barn-buyers have
when things go right

FRED LASHER

I stand by a bus stop

On the bus a sign
DRIVEN BY FRED LASHER.
That couldn't be Fred Lasher,
dead for fifty years.
How could his name be there?

Fred Lasher wouldn't give his name
    to rules
to time to drive a bus
King Lasher and his round forty

I remember
because he wouldn't stay
inside the lines
the lines they draw 
in Washington DC
to mark his borders
where to plant
where to cut his wood

Fred Lasher
had the sense
to cut the wood
where the wood was
just as he shot his deer
when deer were ready
not like the men who came
                                                     
    29

to play at hunting
in red hats
one week ten days
those lines drawn too
in Washington DC
to tell a man
where axes chop
when rifles shoot

Then startled
I remember when I am
why that's Fred Lasher's 
grandson's used his name
I knew it all along
that couldn't be
Fred Lasher

CYRANO DE BERGERAC                               

You are still with us -- artists near and far
remember and respond to your staged call,
between panache and rhyme contestants spar
win honor's victories -- unworthies fall.
While Montfleury remains the sad buffoon
the count returns to make his late adieu.
Now to the last of those who would lampoon
the fool -- extol the true -- add Dépardieu.
Through many characters his skills extend.
The role's magnificence is why we came,
courageous acts have brought us to attend
upon this presentation's fresh acclaim.
How fortunate for worlds of life and show
Rostand picked  up your old book, Cyrano.

RIME AT LAST                                     

All through the gloaming it clustered
Shy-trumpeted softly to branches
On trashbags and other fall oranges--
School out and time for loud building
Of play-worship backyard snow henges.





CAIN                                                  
     
If that blunt shovel hadn't been so right,
so fitted to the swing; as if I needed that.
I hadn't thought his head would be so soft.
The red life running out of him, out of him,
in all ways going deeper, deeper.
All the questions, all the bother.
Well let me ask a question:
who really is my father?
Let me ask another question:
am I my brother's keeper?

 WORDSWORTH

The daffodils are strong when they in groups
upon the hill have danced where Dorothy
has seen them; suddenly, a burst of light.
She brought me lines that I was pleased to use
and hardly change, but other flowers here
are far more delicate, although not rare;
such rarity not always what it takes
to seem too rich and precious to destroy.
I think especially of  violets.
Dear Dorothy has told me she has seen
these flowers in the lawn where as we walk
our feet crush two or three with every step;
as if we were not quite allowed to walk
on earth, great bumbling burdens that we are;
Or walk with a permission and a love.
These are not the minions of nature
like hills that brood above me on the lake
or sing a joy of life. These little ones
are almost secret in a beautiful
and waiting life.  "They also serve who ...wait?"
They do and so do we: they make us think
that we must delicately go considering
the smallest things of earth as part of life
of us the patient voices underfoot:
Take care with each new step or all is lost.
I said that daffodils are strong, but here
a strength that is beyond what we can know

                                                    
          33


from far outside our lives, comes into us.
These violets will not  be turned away
I've seen men turn the soil where violets
were growing, men believing they destroyed
the little flags of sky that hide between
the vigorous and overtaking green.
Then three or even four years later
walking on the cultivated fields
the grass defeated for the sake of beets
I find between the rows and in the rows
the violets alive as ever,  seeds
of these contrary bits of loveliness
have waited, waited and then sprung to life
to call the farmer to  his task, to call 
the color of defiance, to defy
all forces for the cause of life, of life
for its own sake, for messages that come
from an abiding  infinite in things,
the little  things, the least of these -- the Bible
has that phrase -- and who in that plowed field
were then about to own the very ground
or to inherit, as they say, the earth.

WILD CHILD                         

We found by chance your hiding place,
We saw the bright light of your skin
Scared, dirty face.;
Saw through your eyes,
Within,
That what had left you savage, kept you wise.

We couldn't leave you well alone
For what kind care or tenderness
Could you have known?
You scratched and bit,
A mess. 
We held you in my coat, you had a fit.

We taught, retaught, you passed no test,              
Although you were no common boy;
You had expressed
With silent mouth
The joy
That rapt you when the wind was from the south.

Or, when the moon had grown to full,
You drank that light as it were fire
Your strength could pull
From cold night air.
Inspired,
I stood and watched the moonlight in your hair.



35
One night, next to the window, barred,
You stood between the curtains, drawn.
The sky, ill-starred;
I heard you sing
What dawn 
Might sing: you listened to uncommon things

You gathered darkness in your arms,
Your movements quick and light as birds
With forest charms
To judge us by:
No words,
Voiced images in language we can't cry.

Nothing of success, we let you wait
The wearing years out, out of view.
Ward of the state,
You broke your cage 
And flew
At thirty-three -- odd number, mystic age.

UNCAGED 

He let the bird go free. He wanted it
to sing to him, to be his loving nature.
Too late he thought of hawks unloving nature.
It perched within a tree, it ate a cherry.
Too soon he ran to catch what had been his.
He gave away... had given to the sky.

STYLE ( YEATS )                      

Make poems as closely as you can
a talk someone rewrote.
Let language sing,
not man.
When Yeats was living he had said these things.

The matching of it all is the surprise
with nothing stretched or cropped.
The fall
and rise
of lines must seem but casually dropped.

Yet Yeats did not pursue 
the even line the measured phrase. 
We should have that, too.
The words in time
with all the care rewriting thoughts entails.

Most of all he showed
how music swells
so fine
from brief and broken modes
like bells
while slower reading rides and lifts
              the longer line

 OLD                                       

i
Let us hope for something old
not this everlasting new
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold
ii
not too much paving where trucks rolled
get rid of bolt and screw
Let us hope for something old
iii
what has been so oft extolled
beauties time has proven true
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold
iv
men on white horses strong and bold
both tough in sinew as in hew
Let us hope for something old

v
stories not too often told
along with forms the ancients drew
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold

vi
books not bound but scrolled
no acid paper, stained with glue
Let us hope for something old
like oak trees, mountains, woven gold


39                LAZINESS
	
We washed each tin can as we ate the soup;
We folded cardboard when they mailed us books;
We stopped the poison on the lawn--if looks
And weeds get worse, we said, 
		let neighbors snoop.
We were a righteous, an important, group.

We built up compost, 
                 cleaned out trash from brooks;
We spoke of wastrels as moronic crooks.
We were fantastic, a most loyal troop.
But did we stop the ammunition train;
Did we protest when children's funds were cut;
New prisons built, and  welfare clinics shut;
Or write a letter about acid rain?
We watched the news: they meant to entertain;
A bread and circus politician's strut.

POLONIUS ADVISES THE WHITE QUEEN  
		
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Your friends will think it's poetry, you know.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.
	
A cherché word is a linguistic crime.
Use normal speech, with touches of argot.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
	
Bring friends who quote you, say "That sounds
sublime."
Bring your own booklet, everywhere you go.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.
	
If, by chance, you can't think of the right word      
                  
 Fast  enough, don't let the tension climb;
               hum a little, mumble something low.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
	
If "at home" won't fit, try "chez moi," "zu Heim"
Or "en casa," whatever seems more 
		"comme il faut."
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.

Never let a line end awkwardly,  I'm
Sure you will agree.  Keep proper stress also.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.

TRITE ON RYE                              

Everything I need is in the river.
The people playing on the cliff above
will fall and I will save them, be a saver --
is that a role I can be worthy of?

Hoping they will listen, come to borrow,
use what has been harvested from years.
Hold them, let them pay all back tomorrow
once the cloud of cold confusion clears



STREAMS OF CONSCIOUS                     

Rains storm down
punch the grass
moles and hole dwellers
cower in cold wait
a wash upon the street
stones cluster downhill
somewhere along a valley 
ox-bows writhe 
somewhere further 
beyond perceived dimensions
a wholeness takes in all this pulling and shoving
with a surface calm

I wouldn't mind
having a friend
who could pick up an axe
swing it true with skill and joy
cut wood
I wouldn't mind
teaching any rule
rack the balls  pick up a cue
lose to him at pool
I wouldn't mind
meeting
a mountain child
whose thinking was
five thousand 
years ago

FATHER-IN-LAW

She knew the clock was ticking off alarm
Before they found him in the snow as cold
As January... Eighty-five years old --
Too many years to fret about what harm
He suffered... long retired from the farm
His crops all in, his house and tractor sold,
And all his loving stories told, retold.
For weeks she walked as if he'd need her arm

Now is the time for something new,
we have enough of what is old,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

All digital and not coucou,
not magic woods with bridges trolled,
now is the time for something new.

A drink of marvelous fresh brew
Effervescently kept cold,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

Not tapestries now turning blue,
pages yellowed that can't fold,
now is the time for something new.

Who cares what Aristotle knew?
What do latest studies hold?
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

Modernity must now eschew
what has faded, smells of mold,
now is the time for something new.
Razzle dazzle and frou-frou.

To finish this one breath and then one more
As we must work as we have been addressed
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

One dusted sunray columned to the floor
Has strength to hold the sky; so has this quest
To finish this one breath and then one more

The rise and fall of years, of fortunes... or
The rise and fall of breathing: we invest
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

If laughing be too strong to face, so sore,
Without the strength to turn all with a jest
To finish this one breath and then one more

If love seem worn, yet to be loved, we swore
Although it's harder than we could have guessed
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

If life seem faded yet its holds restore
To try our weakness is to judge our best.
To finish this one breath and then one more
This lifetime labor, this brief moment's chore

TWO QUATRAINS

All day my spirit picks up bits
of paper on the street.
At night each candy wrapper fits
a dreaming; fruited, sweet.

My life may be your book, my dear;
or, then again, one word
left chancily upon an ear
that listened, chose, and heard.

 DRAW                                                 
                             

to draw a line where there has been no line
and such a line as clears a telling space
to make a song where there has been but sound

and such a song as reaches through the mind
to write some words with meaning out of sleep
with such a swelling thought that feelings trace

all words from other words their meanings build
let what we draw or write find solid base 
let songs re-echo what will not be stilled

this is a task a person well may keep
so let us read and pass the book around
so let us sing and listen to such grace

as charms the air and comforts those who weep
as treasures care and lights a smiling face

TAKING STEPS                                         

We have imagined toads 
so now we need
a garden that is real
with hedging room
for all the claims and clutter 
that accumulate
from wasteful non-intended
we'd
be first to grow
to where the worm will feed
whatever doubling myth such words assume
wherever this pathology might lead
into a garden seed
becoming flower
into a mind
whatever mind develops from or grows into
shreds
of conscious here and there
gathered strands
of spooling galaxies
where servants weak but human
teach
a crippled god to walk






48       

NORTHERN SKIES                                        
   

The sky above this garden is a-blaze
With shimmer running almost to Orion;
A ghostly movement crosses half the sky
A living luster trembling through a phase.

Finding star-to-star form we plan by,
Remembering by murmuring of ion,
Here between a willow and the stream,
Let's wait awhile to watch our planet dream.



 FOLLOWING FIRE

After the fires, the tourists came
Hoping the camps would be the same
But the trees were gone.  The bear
And deer moved to higher ground. Everywhere
Were the scars of flame.

We'd lost--we thought--what has been ours--
The great pine groves, the cedar towers
where a million people came each year--
Wiped out--whole mountainsides burned clear.
Then came the flowers.



               49

A TREE

A tree pretends
to be symmetrical
The tree pretends
that between each root
each twig
a magic straw
of sweets and waters
makes it possible
to draw
from mushroom roots
and cold worm trails
the happy efflorescence
of an orange or a pear

THIRD PERSON PLURAL

I have too many fathers
every week or two a new one
mother brings in another
she doesn't pile them up much
one at a time actually three or four
on her string at one time
no one-night stands-class of person here 
not cheap --dont read this for a cheap thrill
bug off  it aint here
my elbow to you

some like to pretend
they are married to her
what I meant by too many father
so they pretend with me too
I'm always around
really here constantly the kid
to whatever parental action is happening

up early getting breakfast
three mos of the time
go ahead make three
don't ask don't bother
about seven-thirty make noises
create a good food smell
breakfast clatter
milk cereal for me


51

mother toast eggs juice coffee
third breakfast
never an order
three-egg omelet
Texas toast oatmeal potatoes
sausage  a killer

if the big third breakfast goes begging
I have a big lunch
dont' go to school on those days
mom and me alone telling stories
watching morning soaps
snuggled together
lots of food
Good time just the two of us
but if the third breakfast person
wants to hang around hang out
then goof to whatever else 
he pretends to be
me the naive kid
helpful easy hug me
if mother is there ok
hugs without mother right there bug off
the elbow to the macho rib cage
not gradual
a first strike situation
I ain't out to lose
--no sex abuse here-- 
bug off-read a different story-- bug off--

52

School calls to remind us
morning is getting serious
about arriving
I go at least every two weeks
to avoid getting on lists
as one who is thoroughly out
to beat the system
often enough so the school
gets paid for having you 
-- act up bad so teachers
won't care whether you show up.

What mother wants to do
when she gets rich
is go to London
for weeks walk fancy
eat artichokes 
the right way
get so 
proper people will watch her
to see which fork to use
charge admission
to her living room
highest price to those
at her feet who touch her furs

what a dreamer, my mother.

THE VOYAGER 

The voyager

the nasty snarl that slices daytime
far too thin

the fix we are in.

PRAY

If you want to go ahead and pray
I'll wait out here and watch the clouds a while,
it won't make any difference today.

The piper has come by to get his pay
you know pay the piper don't you?  Smile
if you want to, go ahead and pray

after the heat of the day
heartaches are deeper
after the strength of the having

knows his reasons for dying

a passion for life
outweighed by measures of death
she hears his questions

UNHEARD

I am Pueblo
of the village
People's Canyon.
You enter my rooms
where your presence is taboo
You walk where I walk
you do not see me in this wan dusk
You would wrap me in linen
and cure me with spice
I do not appear to you
I live where only my people
can truly live
Where we have sequestered
since the great drought and famine
do not touch me
do not call me
I am Pueblo

LOCKABLE SHELL

a semi-picnic
in our half-built house
a cage-like structure
where we sit
teetering on joists
the sunlight free
through walls
reflecting board off board
a play of dust and angles
shaping us inside
the iridescence
of our semi-precious years

we planned
too young
to have a house
you dreamed
each part superbly placed
money lenders though
require squared off corners
enforcing on our space
a cubist non-concern
we still have what we need
a living room
two eyes a nose et cetera
the relative positions
seem to matter less and less

61 

eager to leave
old rented views
to get on
with split-level modes
away from unknown lights
that flicker in dark doors
although even here
the odds on rainy days
have thrown a roof
between us and a sky

we have a plot
for morning glories
near a tree
palmed skyward to grow
the substance of a house

where as yet
no separations rise
nothing has been lost
no clutter complicates the day

which
however perfect now
we move to have a shell
enclose the sea-sound
of our lives.

MONDRIAN  I

where has he gone for so long
a new worm colony
a juicier fruit

so long

so he is not coming back
and me alone
with the nest of little ones
fly around all day
pick up
for the family
keep myself going 
besides

I might as well fly off
be done with it
one of us at least
would make 
a season of it

he was a good provider
faithful
sharp hunter
strong flyer
always a saucy flare
a lot of beak
his way

MONDRIAN II

flying has moments 
of sheer delight
swoops sweeps
that carry a heart
out of a body

my wings
seemed hardly part of me
diving to soar again
driving against the air

then
a moment of discovery
a squared-off bit of sky

strange double
overlapping world

I drove
that ended it
the crash
the fall
the hurt

all summer sunsets
climaxed
to one break

MONDRIAN  III

the dumb thing
flew right into that window
they'll do that
this time
so  hard
it broke the glass
that's unusual
but to stand there
holding the dead bird

not knowing
what to do with it
making a big deal of it
well most likely
needing
something to do
sitting by his window
all day
nothing done

MONDRIAN  IV
shattering
that what anyone can see through
is so readily forgotten
but one moment
before everything gave way
someone took me
for an entrance
            


                65
but there is never time
one short glimpse
for gettng ready
crowding crystals
in the right places
to make the design
important
at least noticeable
not to be disappointing

MONDRIAN  V

bird at my window
crashing and gone
leaving me nothing
but cracks
across my outside view

one line horizons my space
two others
rising from a conmon point
draw me outward
infinite
a fourth
is a meander
downward

on the ground
the bird struggles
death or long suffering
66

leaves me 
decision
how to be merciful
with this miracle

SONG FOR SHEPHERDS

How could she have known that in the days
before his birth the stars converged to grow
a brightness meant to let some shepherds know
what stars were doing: concentrating rays
as but symbolic for a larger phase
of new ideas knotting  to let glow
(historical significance) to throw
life's meaning backward with a craze
for taking god so bloody big in ways
that numbed the brain -- that thwarted mental flow --
imagined god above and life below.
The separation crosses and betrays 
the hope of once discovering the tie:
the 'one' of grass-plain ground with clear blue sky
                                                      
    67

FORGETTING

The places I remember far away
The places I remember that are near
All memories I lose each passing day

What was that lighted town, a bright display
Sky-high, it was? or so it did appear. 
The places I remember far away

Where was that town they couldn't let us stay
They had a festival tat time of year.
All memories I lose each passing day

Who was that friend who taught us how to say
the foreign phrases we found so hard to hear.
The places I remember far away

A frame with  nothing in it, gone what may
More than regret, the emptying I fear
All memories I lose each passing day

I want back all that brightness gone to grey
Whole reaches of a life no longer clear.
The places I remember far away
All memories I lose each passing day

STREET PERSON	

under those sweet rags
one with narrative legs
who has vomited stars
crossing and crossing
the lanes to safe homesteads
breaking the bars
of the polite avenne
hear your friends have scurried
with words in the corners
of their eyes under lights which burn tears
they do not end with counting
themselves each other
give back what is no longer in them
to see again the harvest
in the green blade tremble
teach the three-month
pregnancy of foodstuff
love the hollow in them
their stomach and their soul
unfed they neither drown nor swim
in the currents of their commerce
nor sleep on the mattresses
of fruitful bearing
nor stop in their dreams
until all nights are one
they say what fire dare not say
then die with having been
the voice of all.

WORK

work they tell us
on the roadway
bring pick and shovel
lunch sweatbands
for the head
get there
no foreman
no gang
no work
the roadway all done
white lines painted
signs up
traffic going by
we stand around
we swing a pick
a rock clatters
to the river
we whoop lope
we chase crayfish
waer bonecold
walk home
we had expected work
brough pick and shovel
lunch
fine doings
none of us
was going

ROBERTSDOTTIR

I'd like to go back to the good old days
when we were together two friends
but nothing so delicate ever stays
ephemeral means it soon ends

those days were friendly and sporty
those days were happy and fine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we went fishing but there was no nibble
our bobbers just floated around
but we found no reason to quibble
we examined a rock we had found

and a butterfly wing and a dorty
then back to the cabin to dine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine

we built a campfire for cooking
but couldn't find very much wood
so there we were I somehow looking
so stupid right there where I stood



                                                   

73
but you said, "oh what does it matter
we'll go buy a bundle of pine"
when I was but forty and fatter
and you were a lady of nine

you needed more tail on your spring kite
and I couldn't find any string
the whole project just wouldn't go right
so instead you decided to sing

well I didn't know how to fly it
but the sun continued to shine
I was forty and needed to diet
and you were a lady of nine

you skinned your knee it was bleeding
but you wouldn't shed any tears
just a band-aid was all you were needing
and help with the bicycle gears

I came with a small pair of pliers
a band-aid and no iodine
I was forty and good with spare tires
and you were a lady of nine

TEACHER


if she had words enough and time
she'd reach the feelings and the mind
of those who seek to  grow and climb
beyond the world where they're confined

not that her world has further scope
not that her world has gentler clime
but that she hoped or had seen that hope
give shape to what was else resigned
when to the struggle darkenss yields
in what was meant  to be sublime

VILLAGE SCENE	

When electricity
first came on
lampposts
had circles
around them

townsfolk
being bright.


DIMMER VIEW
 
they all say
take it easy
take it easy
they leave
with hurting handshakes
surface smiles
 
Take it easy
as if I could
control intensities
dark now 
bright later.
 
I don't know
where the levers are
I can't find the dials.

SOLUTION

A sharp stinging flavor, 
a cane,
a very large string, 
a floor of a ship,
the buried line of a precious metal:

He agonizes over the remaining clues 
to the Sunday crossword puzzle.
Suddenly he stands up as the  tart odor
of fresh blueberry pie 
reaches his nostrils.
He grabs his walking stick, 
swing the honors 'rope' 
over his shoulder, 
ignors the solitaire deck 
strewed behind him, 
and begins the grand march, 
not feeling the weak spot 
in his aorta gives way in the last struggle
of the artery to hold itself together

LEADING
What am I leading on my string?
Is it a calf my father 
Made it mine
	special attention
	constant care
	something like love
		milk-fed
vealed at four months

Is it a rabbit
	to catch in a wire snare
	I had read about it
	followed the directions
	made one
	it didn't work

Is it a stick of wood
	constant, unchanging
	keeping the carved letters
	of the new three-blade jack knife
	lost a week later

Is it another string
	and then another string
	so all the vealed
escaped			lost
	episodes go back and back
	a soiled concatenation
		of knots

RETIRED PROFESSOR	
			
  And still they gazed and still the wonder 
That one small head could carry all he knew	Oliver Goldsmith
	
The time for line recitals came and he--
Within the context of discussions, talk,
Would quote at length--by couplet, word, or phrase--
Bring in related episodes or thoughts--
An innuendo somehow might connect
To longer passages; poetic moods
Or feelings were as likely as ideas
To string one poem to another, warm
Emotions always overflowing; love
Of line and liner, work as well as worker,
Nobly cited, blessing from the blessed
Upon the meek, the poor, the laborers;
With culminations of compacted joy.
	
As ever were his thoughts to gladness turned
To ride the waves of love's sad happy times:
A dividend -- through hard years -- he had earned

GUM FENCE

        An old house left alone			
Not much cleared land 			
some city pioneer
		did not imagine
		forty acres
	
When Hamlin was five
his sisters had a story
to keep him out of that decaying house
	
		The monster, green, invisible,
		but stopped by the gum fence
		that existed only to the monster.
	
Gum fence?  gigantic chewing gum?
	
			Later he knew
		the fence was made of resin
			dropped
			from aboriginal pinetrees
			decomposed long ago
		evoked by sisters to protect
	
Now, how to harvest that old gum:
			so often people need
			that good gum fence



82
HOOK

The dog crept off into the brush to hide 
the pain of the fish hook pulling his fur.
He  thought he had been hurt to death, 
and death is private for a dog.  When the hook
fell loose the dog had hung his head and slunk
toward to us, crawling low and shameful, back
to where he had to come, fish hook and all.

You left because the words had hurt some place
of secrecy; a pain that seemed like death 
and was a death of sorts.  Your coming back 
was not in shame but proud, for if we said
some words that hurt, you would not bear the blame



DAY AND NIGHT

if day must arrive
keep it gradual
so the dreamworld fades one bit
then another

my two lives need pillows 
between each other
cushions to comfort the rocks
something with feathers


83

MY MAPLE					
        
I study 				
the maple in my yard
with clippers in my hand
Neighbors' trees
have no branches
lower than six feet.
My tree shows no trunk at all.
It is overgrown.
One neighbor calls it "lazy tree."
I could trim it off
to look like others' trees.
The grass is thin
The soil shows black
some weeds are taking root.
	
			A woman with a buggy
			stops mid-street.
			Her hands reach out 
			and out and out
			to hug my tree.
	
			My tree rests lightly
			on the lawn
			a ball of thirty feet
			ready to bounce 
			should one so mighty
			in a need to  play
			come by.

INSIDE ME

there's a kid who lives inside me
who doesn't like my life
he wasn't ready for the things
that led to all this strife

there's a kid who lives inside me
who keeps looking through my eyes
he tries to tell me where to go
and what to do, he tries

I pretend I haven't even heard
the pesky way he nags
finally I tell him he's absurd
so then he chokes, he gags

there's a kid who lives inside me
who keeps listening through my ears
he teases me. he pesters me
he plays upon my fears

he keeps thinking that he has control
forgets he's locked inside
he wants me to go swimming
to play ball to go and slide



 
85

he's a loser he's a pouter
he's a loner he's a kluts
he says I'm a down and outer
hanging idle smoking butts

get lost I tell him it's my time
to develop with  my friend
you brat you dunce out of my heart
you force me to pretend

and then I think perhaps that kid
is part of  my life still
I remember all the things he did
but oh he can get shrill

he gets nasty nasty really weird
like almost gone insane
he stomps and says he'll pull my beard
he shrieks inside my brain

he'll stamp his feet upon my heart
he'll stomp his feet and shout
he wants more of the acive part
or else he's coming out







86                 WAR                                
              
    Rather than to treat the topic war 
    Ignore 
    Atrocities of nations raging mad. 
    We've had 
    Too much to do with power and press. 
    The mess 
    That runs world-wide across our lands 
    And hands. 
     
    But if a man in uniform came by, 
    We'd cry 
    For dead or legless children in his arms. 
    What harms 
    Us most is knowing just one face to face 
    Disgrace, 
    So can we hope for normal happiness? 
    Try 'yes.' 
     
    There was a child once in a photograph 
    With half 
    Her skin charred black, her clothing gone, 
    Still on 
    And on she goes, as does her scream. 
    No dream 
    Today can be complete without her fear 
    Held dear. 
 




87 
    Whatever megadeaths we learn to deal 
    We feel 
    Projections prove we'll lose but half our race. 
    We face 
    The future confident. That screaming child, 
    Reconciled. 
    Will not die --live forever-- facts are in 
    Her skin.

   REGRET

it wouldn't have been half bad
the six or seven couples who
wanted to go off with what we had
and live together for a year or two
far apart from all this come and go
to find a mountain where the sun and glow
at sunrise and again come dusk the way
a rising peak can find a longer day
it wouldn't have been half bad
if we had dared to shuck it all and leave
sometimes I wish I really wish we had
we work jobs when we should go chop or weave
we work away for things that if done right
we'd make a trade-off for our laziness sake
and do not see our lack of sight

CLAY POT 
     
    Where will we be 
    my friends, 
    when someone tells us 
    that if we are more than 
    ordinarily 
    	intelligent 
    	lucky 
    	devoted 
    	good with our hands 
    we may 
    within a lifetime 
    produce a pot 
    as good as a thousand pots 
    buried 
    under ten thousand years 
    of village dust.

RAG ELEPHANT 
     An admiration of a poem by
                Carlos Drummond de Andrade 
     
    The bones are pieces of a broken chair. 
    The skin is heavy cotton, wool for hair. 
    Buttons, of course, clever threads, a face. 
    Four walking cans. Ears; floppy pillowcase. 
     
    A rolled up trunk, eager to hold, to lift. 
    Real tusks. That lasting liquid eye, a gift. 
    On each side, glued-on flowers 
		and small clouds. 
     
    No one looks or smiles in all the crowds 
    He ambles through; so, tired past love tonight, 
    Each piece he will fold neatly, wrap just right. 
     
    For now, he strides, he sways. 
		He owns the street.
    The tail almost drops off, cloth drags, his feet 
    Scrape.  The too-thin chair parts 
		creak and bend. 
    He is all grace; hoping to find a sad friend.

WHAT HAMLIN SEES

What I see out my window is snow 
		and exciting woodlands 
what I  hear from the playground is 
		ballgames and cheering
what I  read from friends is meaningful
		in caring and sharing
what I try to give back is caring 
		and feelings of life  
love of life

I know many people suffer
		only because they 
have no one to talk to
to write  so I write I write to those
who never answer
I write to those
who can't write
I write to those who answer
every letter
I write to those
who are fooling me
I write  to those
who really need some words
I write to the old people
I write to the young people
words for the parents
who dont know how to tell
their children that they love them
     A love too long untold

NO WORD
                        
                        The friend has made no visit
                        for eight weeks
                        Has feigned a loss of sense
                        in what he speaks.
                        
                        The world will listen first
                        then execute
                        Must he by that acclaim
                        afraid fall mute?
                        
                        I loiter where he wrote
                        that hardest line
                        I'd have him back to taste
                        a useful wine.

CARVE

I would carve a smile
upon the mountain
we have enough
of Jeffersonian heavies
all presidential frown
or crazed indian
a Charlie Brown
or What-me-worry
type of smiling
We need a mountain smiling
day to day

WHO

Hemingway, my dear attentive students
wrote the story "Old Man and the Sea."
You've read it now, I'm sure,
	for I assigned it.
Tell me what the messge seemed to be.

A silence from the class
	of high-school juniors
waiting for the lecturer to go
still on and on, it surely would go on
so much to explicate, so much to show.

The fish, the wounded hands, 
	the shouldered mast
you see it, don't you,
how 'Old Man" was cast?
Some students nodding gravely
	clearly followed
each idea, everything I said
while others only had the fun of knowing
something big had passed them overhead
 







93

One student closed his book so quick so loud
in anger, I perceived, disturbed and proud.
I don't remember him, so many classes,
his lips were firm with something held in check.
He had blue model paint flecks on his glasses,
something softly trembled in his neck.
Then he asked twice
a simple question: Who
are... you.. ?  Who are you?

HAMLIN'S WINDOW
	

When he looks at the window he sees specks
enduring glass, frame edges that need paint,
collections of a world of dust with stained
reminder of the children who reflect..

Wen he looks in the window, he sees now --
The furniture, her things that decorate,
a table top, a stand, the TV screen
They watch together after dinner, how
the years have changed some things, while others wait
While decades pass; a comfortable scene.

When he looks out the window to inspect
the trees he planted, all those that remain
provide them too much shade.  What has gained:
success in life too late now to reject..

JADE CARVING ONE

A palace of fallen rocks redressed,
Time-decorated in the green
Of midget brush, primeval moss;

Cloud degrees of gray, near-white is best
To mute the shade of this tinted scene.
Wind-bent, storm-shaped treetops toss

The free-form curtain clouds apart:The welcome rocky
path be seen.
Whre can a plain man hope to start?



JADE CARVING TWO

A oalace of rocks, a drink-deep moat
Of mountain's glacier splashes cold,
Twisted among the struggled trees.

Cold helps the ardent man devote
His tme andstrength, as he grows old,
Tot asks best done each day on knees.

The sound of swirling wind off snow,
Adrift with darkened clouds, has told
How rough the weathering day will go.
95
JADE CARVING THREE

A palace of rocks, the sun-storm wind
Has swept the resting valley clear.
Life fights  for holds at timberline;

The soil around the small roots thinned.
The harvest age of the mountain year
Continues with work of birch and pine.

Here is the home, the private place,
We pause by the woodsman andwe hear
His echoed song fromt he tall rock face.

JADE CARVING FOUR

A palace of rocks an cordwood piled
High for the seasoned to be shipped.
A working sun rides hot and brihgt

High is best for life in the wild,
Bare were rock and snow have lsipped
Cutting a path to the hard-won height.

Where man must ever live out-guest
Below the highest rock wind-stripped,
Where cold clear green arrives refreshed.

   HERITAGE REWRITTEN 
Grandma lost all patience over Grampa. 
    His nodding off at supper 
    His sipping wine 
    	cigars 
    	cigars with ashes 
    	always ashes. 
She takes the poems of his pages 
    	how the moon 
    	had broken off to stars 
    	(and others no one read 
    	had ever read) 
    And throws them in the fire. 
Oh, sweet and final vengeance 
    	she gives him ashes. 
While I with always ashes in my pen 
    I do these pages.

WAITED

We waited such a long time for your call
We jumped each time the senseless phone 
		would ring
Each car door slamming was another wall

Of time built up around us--time to crawl
Through hours till morning--frightened 
		time to  cling
We waited such a long time for your call

We held our breath and heard small 				sounds grow tall
We wondered what the next mail truck 
		might bring
Each car door slamming was another wall

The sirens wailing were the worst of all
The come-and-go: a child's gone-crazy swing
We waited such a long time for your call

How heavy silence is in its slow fall
How long life is when measured by its sting
Each car door slamming was another wall

Those sirens with that manic high-pitched bawl
What can they mean in memory anything?
We waited such a long time for your call
Each car door slamming was another wall

BOOK

There must be something to this book he wrote
I tried an outline, couldn't find a thread;
Something to rememeber, lines to quote

I read the whole book, couldn't take a note
All these words, what is it he has said
There must be something to this book he wrote

The need for meaning gathered in my throat
To find where all his learnèd effort led
Something to remember, lines to quote

His images, not especially vague, remote.
Where precisely have my senses fled?
There must be something to this book he wrote

From all angles no way does it denote
Some light to guide us as most books have shed
Something to remember, lines to quote

Perhaps it's just his way to stay afloat
As a professor, publish or be dead.
There must be something to this book he wrote
Something to remember, lines to quote

LIFE AS ART

to make of life an art
a voyage as by boat
a worthy wave-bashed craft
held together by design
not afraid to enter
to go now slow now fast

as life itself demands -- go far
go slow, adjustment is the art
of how to come and go.. to enter
as the powers of design
a bold and built together craft

attempting art.. achieving craft
a slow approach departing fast
get out by knowledgeable design
is art
knowing the waters and the boat
knowing when it is time to enter

PAEAN TO THE PRESS
		
When David McDee read the news on TV
There never was murder or stealth
Just birthdays and weddings (new recipes, too)
And people inheriting wealth.
	
How Mrs. McDee's flower bed came along,
How neighbors had torn down the fence.
Such positive bits of informative news
To David, made imminent sense.
	
Soon arsonists found they were fresh out of work;
Oil profits had lost half their fun;
What's the use in sensation if nobody knows,
If the news won't include what is done.

When David McDee read the news on TV,
The weather was sunshine and warm.
The sports casts concerned only games 
		that were won;
All losses considered bad form.
	
When David McDee read the news on TV
Pure innocence lighted our eyes
There were no surprises or odd little wrongs:
All greetings and never goodbyes

INTRODUCTION TO A LONG SEQUENCE
OF VILLANELLES

The painter, what parallel unpolared place                                                   
did he perceive, yet dare not quite reveal;                   
 with what senses did that child feel
                    before the artist God-like had erased.
                        
   Did this unheard-from brother want to try
   the powers that make us what we are or seem
to be; the colored flights of old forgotten dreams;
where were the loves he needed standing by?       
Into what world of love has he returned
   unfulfilled, all he might be, unlearned?

	I

How did it happen that we lost the song?
forgot the flesh inside the ghosts we saw?
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

We paid each bill. Each task that came along
We took, we listened, followed every law.
How did it happen that we lost? The song

Goes on -- each measure then was strong
and stronger still with every breath we'd draw
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

We thought the best of living would belong
to us. Indeed, perfection without flaw.
How did it happen?
           That we lost the song

is obvious as we have known so long.
Caresses now revert to skin rubbed raw.
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.

Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.
How did it happen that we lost the song?

  When night turned over, it began to snow.
  Still, all your friends knew what to talk about.
  I left a child I thought you'd like. To know
                        
 each other seemed a little way to go.
 Too far to be forgiven, it turned out. 
 When night turned over, it began to snow.
                        
The sky changed color, greyed-off orange glow
with darker streaks 
		--then you found voice to shout.
I left. A child I thought you'd like to know
                        
came, ready to play and ready to grow.
It was almost as if we'd picked him out.
When night turned over, it began to snow.
                        
A mind gives birth, though no one proves it so.
A figment sharing want, wait, dream, and doubt.
I left a child I thought.
                        You'd like to know
                        
A child -- a flesh and blood child head to toe;
as baby, reader, runner, spender, scout.
When night turned over, it began to snow.
I left a child I thought you'd like to know

When, after hours, we stayed awake and tried
 with what poor means 
		or lack of means we found
 to deal with life: What life? I laughed, you cried
                        
 for you held so much more than I inside.
 We never did meet on an even ground.
 When after hours we stayed awake and tried
                        
to play each other, testing love, defied
what others might consider safe and sound
to deal with live. What life? I laughed. You cried                        

No more pretense, no more one of us tied
on to the other; both in one death drowned.
When after hours we stayed awake and tried
                        
while all our senses seemed to override
what our own actions made our lives expound
to deal with life, "What life?" I laughed.
                                                 You cried
 
to deal with life. I took it all in stride.
You were too much to your own values bound
when after hours we stayed awake and tried
to deal with life. "What life?": 
		I laughed, you cried.

After that I thought about the child              	
What kind of life he'd have if he were real
and partly civilized but mostly wild.
                        
Not part of our life, hurting and defiled;
with pain that even time seems not to heal.
After that I thought about the child
                        
living on without me. Once I dialed
a number where he might be living. He'll
be partly civilized but mostly wild,
                        
I told myself, a muscled full life, styled
on ax and hammer, sinew, fire and steel.
After that I thought about the child
                        
small in my arms, small in my life, beguiled
and reaching for what living might reveal
partly civilized but mostly wild:
                        
wild like meadows, birds, like seas green-isled,
yet tame to hear what people say they feel.
After that I thought about the child
As partly civilized but mostly wild.

How we have hoped together, love, for years
When only moments now and then come by.
We have not cared enough. Between our fears
                        
  Of loving and our love, what interferes
  is so much loss which leaves us both to cry:
How we have hoped together, love, for years.
                        
That life we thought we'd found, 
		which now appears
had love too long left out, for you and I,
we have not dared enough. Between our fears
                        
of separation and reunion, leers
the monster loneliness. We but but reply 
how we have coped together love for years.
                        
Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
Where have our lives gone? No time left to try.
We have not shared enough. Between our fears



Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
We have not shared enough. Between our fears.

On nights that I was animal, and you
sang me into human form again,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.
                        
Those many nights my wilder form outgrew
attempts to hold me, none could be my friend.
On nights that I was animal, and you
                        
 into another world in fear withdrew
 with other knowledge without where or when,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.
                        
The storming rage you had to see me through,
my deepest wrath--I was not loving then--
On nights that I was animal.  And you

you had the hardest time, yet somehow knew
to conquer those strange weaknesses of men.
You helped my heart its nobler sense renew.
                        
That I have wronged you, all would say is true,
yet would you sing, my faults you would defend
On nights that I was animal.  And you,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.

NOW

However much we work and win and laugh
and boast historic monuments supreme,
build on older masteries; the theme
all charged with our best thoughts, 
		our group belief
in their eternity is foolish--brief
is the "forever" of our dazzling dream.
No matter how magnificent they seem
they blow away with their own epitaph.

The door to this already is ajar:
the pictures we design, the words we write,
may last a little longer than we do,
then crunch into a nothingness, with new
and old alike all gone.  So what we are
is "now" --this timeless time-- and appetite.

                        born to have lain
                        in cold
                        and listening swamp
                        native

ABOUT NOTHING

when I was six and reading
aloud to the class
and to the teacher
to prove
I was there

the word NOTHING
lay upon the page
with no clue within its sentence
within its context
with no way to pronounce:
No THING
sure to be a snicker

yes, that was what it meant

then the teacher
anxious to cut short 
the silence
rowdy-type students
are eager to fill

gave it to me
NUTHING

MURAL
this letter is a mural
runs along the wall
across the window
right on the glass
write on

one long line
now and then
it runs off sidelines
sidebars
shaped  locutions
of nonsense 
and misguided sagacity

forgets itself 
and runs up 
to the ceiling
falls to the floor
trundles along
out the door
up on the wall again
out in the hallway
leading to the elevator

close the door
don't let it get out
into the lobby downstairs
nothing to stop it with
no way to clean it up

115

now down the street
correctible conclusions
on the curbs of humanity

who now will overcome
this spread of the letter
that is a mural;
will it discover the mountain

and then the valley

how did it get started
this inexhaustible supply
of ink and words
inside a small brush
to swish and slide
on all the surfaces
of the world

CANDLE

Have you seen my candle?
Yes, it's part of the exhibit.
I don't want to tell you
how many hours...
what do you think...

Really?
You have a good eye.

Um, Ma'am...
my candle.
That one.
I'd be embarrassed
to admit
how many hours...

Oriental influence, you think?
Concentricity
with justaposition
in the petrolocity of wax...

All that,
in my candle

I honor your opinion, madam.





117


So I went home
I tried again

No empathy, you said.

So...  years.
But, now,
a final form
avoiding flaw

 but you find a new direction
I could not have known

I will bring it in again
Time and again

Since i have found myself
to be a candlemaker

what else
have I
to do

haiku


loons cry
across flat swamp
and in my heart

virgin coral forest
upwells, nourishes
inner city hood

plant the brick
next to the other brick
room between for grass

step on my body
prone to punishment
pressed to earth

shift down
grind metal teeth
spit gravel 
at the past


knee thigh
warm new
already taken

HANDS
                        
My hands have just held a poem
                        by a friend about her hands.
                        Her hands want to be Italian
                        everybody loves Italian
                        My hands feel Russian
                        having just dropped the fork
                        clattering to the plate
                        they remember the heft
                        of the shovel in the garden
                        Dinner forks take such finesse.
                        
Her hands help her read outloud
                        My hands hang onto the lectern
                        one sneaks inside my shirt
                        I stand there like Napoleon
                        it thinks something important
                        might get said
                        
                        and it offers 
                        a little of the ridiculous
                        for balance
                        to realize later gestures
                        would have helped.
                        My hands like to pretend
                        the tight cramp 
                        of violinists'  fingers but are only
                        good for rooting quackgrass
                        for holding boards for hammers
      
120
 My hands grasp rough stovewood
                        while thinking about being
                        a nest for injured birds
My hands have age-spots diguised as freckles
My hands would like to crawl off into grass
 to creep up on cats
 as clenchers, squeezers
 holders, bangers
 tools for the tough trade
 where they let push come to shove.

My hands meet hands of friends and 
strangers to hold me off.
My hands have never been raised in 
hold-ups or for rescue from drowning
But often in recitation about such things.
When I sleep my hands grasp the bedposts
holding still the tossing night
until the level light of morning. 
My hands marvelously efficient creatures,
how did I come to have hands like these.

Except along the back: conduits,
great wall of China, the trade of empires
the great flow.
Storms inside:
Maelstroms of crashing cargo
Colossal corpuscle-jams
followed by magnificent breakings-loose
thunderous.

ROADS  

Every time we drove that road
it got shorter
which was very important to us
in that horse and buggy
locomotion
with the horse accustomed
to the speed of a plow.

since then 
with all the walking
and driving
we do  
I have recently noticed
that all roads
all paths
reduce themselves
with each use...

but there are those times to reset
so discouraging

STILL LIFE     
   
Not die, not yet,. Here lying trapped, leg pinned 
    beneath a car, no doubt in shock. The sun 
    Two hours along in the morning.  I awake 
    
From lying here all night in death-like trance. 
    So late. No cars. This must be near the road. 
    Went off last night in the dark, but did not roll. 
Flung from the car, then pinned by it. Knocked out. 
    The night went by, a kind of stupor, held 
    a mind left unaware.  Did Mary call? 
   She must be worried.  Matt and Brenda gone 
To their new home will call her: Mom, Dad home? 
    A little worry trembling in the voice. 
 --Not yet,  --So late.  Should call the sheriff, Mom. 
    If she could call me I could tell her, fine. 
    Just fine.  I only have to wait, just luck 
    Bad luck that no one has come by. Some kid, 
    Or hunter, soon enough, will be along 
    In case they really cannot see this wreck 
    
 From cars that race along that winding road. 
    Brenda, such a good wife to this son, 
Would say again, --Call Mom.  She;'s all alone. 
    --So soon? His puzzled son would turn to ask, 
But women have a way of knowing when 
    A call will be important, though so soon.

123
   

--You did so many things I didn't know. 
Such tiny flowers and no color there. 
In two three months the berries will be ripe 
How long can this go on.  The ants will come. 
Sweet berries, purple. Ready to be food. 
Write down a message. Pen still in the car. 
You get it, Mom.  Of course you can't do that. 
Try writing with a finger.  Hurts. The stones, 
The finger bleeds.  A young queen once, she was 
Marie, yes, Antoinette, or was a pin 
what she wrote with.  So poke the pencil down 
into the ground. Make words. Still in the car. 
     
The berry bush is talking. No two kids, 
Are walking by. They look.  
		They run,  Hey, kids. 
Am I a ghost?  They did not see me here? 
Or am I mangled horribly.  They run, 
Two little boys not big enough to help?  
Too bad it scared them so. They are too small 
To pick a car up or cut off a leg. 

Matt, time to call your mother, Mom, Dad home? 
How do you tell  the age of berry bushes?
  In Matt's old science notebook. Look it up. 
  You keep it, Dad, You never throw  stuff out. 
    Keep so much junk.  
                                   

124
                                  Those animals Elaine 
Would make from clay, her tiny fingers knew... 
 All by themselves.  The slimey frog Matt caught 
And cut up in the kitchen. Clean it up. 
This adolescent drawing of the heart. 
I'll clean it up, Dad, don't get sore. 
Nobody cares in science class, you know. 
Nobody cares. No cares go by. Nobody stops. 
Don't call so often. Mom has her still life 
of pears she's working on. Hello, it's Matt. 
I've called again. --So soon.  There's some report., 

    Each little detail, painting, phone calls, pears. 
    It's not so bad, for  nothing is so hard. 
    A stream of warm and  loving consciousness. 
    Is dying what this is?  Is this the time? 
    A loving voice. A comfortable thought. 
    It takes three days at least to die of thirst. 
Drink rain. How much can fall?  
		My mouth too small. 
    Can't catch enough.   It isn't raining here. 
    Go crazy, lying, talking to a mom.
    Well, always it's too late or not prepared 
    so one way or another... --Son, relax. 
    Elaine, you've got to get your homework done. 
    Turn off the radio and clean your room. 
    Your mother told you that an hour ago. 
    How happy she had been on Friday night, 
Came home too late from her first date with... who? 

125
    A Fred, a Ted?  What kind of dad are you 
    That can't remember that young fellow's name. 
Bashful when you met him, couldn't talk 
then couldn't  stop once baseball was brought up. 
    A trickle of fresh blood above the ear. 
    Keep moving.  Maybe that's the way to die. 
    Not yet.  Oh, no, not yet.  Still life, still hope. 
    Until the worms arrive, a conversation. 
  Is it dead yet?  No, not yet. More waiting. 

A bush nearby. Gooseberries now in bloom. 
How do you tell  the age of berry bushes?
How did you know what kind of bush it is? 
We always ate them, Mom, when in the woods. 
    That was a bad one.  Don't sit up or roll. 
    That wave of pain that started from the neck 
 Went down the spine and off into each leg. 
The car might burn.  How do you die in fire? 
 No, Mary, go on painting, don't get up.                        
    Someone will be along. Wait long enough. 
    The berry bush might feed me. 
		Snow is falling. 
    Cool upon my face. Large lazy flakes. 
    It's summer. Can't  be summer. But I feel it. 
    The sun is hot and glaring on my face. 

    Matt, time to call your mother, 
		Mom, Dad home? 
    How do you tell  the age of berry bushes? 
    In Matt's old science notebook. Look it up. 


126
No facts at all yet, Mom.  We're waiting still. 
You have to have the facts to turn it in. 
    
Forget Elaine and Matt, yes, Mary too. 
Forget them all now. It has been so long. 
How can forgetting hurt so? Can't forget. 
Let life go on.  It's their turn now. Let go. 
That workshop project though, not done. 
		The valance 
for the windows in the living room. 
What will Elaine do when she's out of school? 
The college years will be so great for her. 
Those scared kids back again?  The voice. 
A father's voice.  
		Hey, Dad, where have you been? 
--Come stay with me a while, son, work this out. 
You kept your scooter, Matt.  
		You've learned to type, 
 Elaine.  And Brenda's mixing our dessert. 
Somebody's mowing hay.  So hope they see us. 
New voices. Stomping, Now a mighty scream; 
The pain undammed that flows 
		like gushing blood. 
The metal torn and lifted off the leg. 








127
ROOMS

as if each room of the large school   
was  a poem or part of a poem  
students are assigned by age     
or number of rooms                   
they have passed through          
which is called their grade                  

where they go to earn a grade
grades pile up to make a school
which they hope to make their way through
sometimes by memorizing a poem
which is also divided into rooms
especially if from a forgotten age

so each year is an age
and each year is a grade
which means so many rooms
the total  of which is school
of which no one writes a poem
not even when they are through

it is a blast, a ball, the way through  
watching your own increasing  age  
life is a  poem,  
for some an uphill grade 
they cannot finish school 
they get lost in the  rooms

LUTHER BURBANK

I visited the house of Luther Burbank
who must have been forever irksome
to whoever it is 
Who has the appointment to creating
new species

Dear Mr. Burbank would be
disappointed no doubt
to hear that people nowadays
no longer have to plant hundreds
of seeds
and select
by some magically intuitive 
process which ones to allow
to mature...

they just fiddle around with
the inside of a cell
the slush of life
and wrinkle out all those pesky
eyes of a potato
making it much smoother 
for the peeler
who doesn't know
he now has potatoes
he can not plant a piece of
to grow new potatoes

ANGELS, TOO: SAPPHIC QUATRAINS
	
Wonderful!. Alive on this hubbub planet!
Sacrilege to waste even single moments.
Yet I do, in idleness, fiddle, lazy,
Waiting for nothing.

Spirit knocking? Genie to ask my blessing?
Me? To bless a spirit? The wrong direction!
Oh, I beg you! Not for mere man to order--
Angels bless humans.

Hell, you say, has rules that are true and perfect.
Satan keeps accounts on the clientel here.
Checking off each day the transgressions, errors,
Adding and adding.

Rules, you say, are Hell on the mind and spirit.
God intended day to be New, Rewakened.
Humans, therefore, can turn to blessing angels,
Changing relations.

SHEPHERD  

He counts and one is missing, 
		leaves the ninety-nine.
He trusts the congregation of the village flock.  He sees the stray above him on the rising ground.
As he proceeds with courage stronger 
		than the sense 
of caution  through small scratches, bruises;
he resents his aging loss of strength, climbs up.
A columbine has his attention,
As he falls and scrapes his knee,
he rises brushing sand from broken skin,
a thorn he pulls,
the blood congeals against his garment
torn in falling.
He goes on, finds tansey, textile gold,
low wintergreen, pale purple heads of thistles,
three piled stones someone has used 
		to point a way;
an old device he learned before he had grown
	big enough to be alone with sheep...
with sheep... where is the sheep?
Ah, yes, she has come down the slope,
has left the rough and viper-hiding ridges 			dangerous and steep,
to graze on grasses with the group.
Enchanting thirst directs the man
where springtime seepage paused to make
a small still pool of water

131
deep enough to take a drink
by muddy flat and moss.
A pod has burst and scattered seeds.
Now small-leafed vines have grown
around the shaded basin where he kneels,
sees high white clouds, inverted brush, himself,
against the sky.
He washes, lies upon the viny quilt. His hand rests on a sheet of mica hidden under sand, 
a finger-knotted piece of briar,
sharp pink stone, divided from a bed of quartz,
two bits of shell old oceans left
with traces of small animals in hard packed clay,
snake skin, an insect wing, 
claw from a passing bear... so many years while nothing new has come this way,
now anywhere he looks appears this magic spell.
A bee brings him to hidden honey,
rich in herb and flower scents in thickets
where no steps disturb but his...
is that his name his partner calls and calls...
on tricky slopes he half controls his  stride, 
half falls with treasure in his hands,
past the cool-shade stare of cud-relaxing crowd,
down to the village, cries, Look! What I found!
As if some secret would not keep.
What have you found?  
His brother's arm upon him lies.
He can not say exactly...
stammers... says... a sheep!

PICNIC
A day together, picnic without crowds.
 We find a beach the others would reject
 for you insist 
 on water. Clouds
                        reflect
the distant pinetrees, self-effaced in mist.
                        
The wash of short-lived suds on hard-packed 		sand;
the great waves rolling, roaring, laugh and speak
            lines we expect.
            Here we might stand               
	a week
to watch where crumbled mountains lie foam-
		flecked.
                        
 White gull cries, water, rock, air, sand, and sun
  where this stretch are no cans or bottles strewed
            and here we sneak;
            the sore where none              
	intrude
with reasons for the blush upon your cheek.
                        
 You let me find your buttons, ties, and hooks
 to let the sun have you--whle I stay dressed
                        as you run nude
                        you have with looks
                        impressed
  so I am only prudent not a prude.
                                                
 133
 Beneath some trees, as if set by Manet,
 we are a composition "tres superbe"
                        we two at rest
                        "Le déjeuner
                        sur l'herbe"                                                                                                                                                    
  (which still some dull establishments protest).
  
Leaf sounds from bushes, steady, rustling, brisk,
 do not add to the sense we are alone.
                        A little scared--
                        because of risk--
                        (our own)
  and wondering if what we did, we dared.
                         
  Just as you are we run, now brave. We spring
  both laughing as our timid smiles we flash
                        forward to known
                        and unknown things.
                        We dash--
 the raw earth colors blend with your skin tone.
                        
  At least this moment seems both fresh and new.
we pick our careful way through nearby weeds,
                        thistles and burrs.
                        I carry you
                        (good deed)
  but not enough control for what occurs.
                      




134

Earth's surface rises here to rocks, sharp, sheer.
 Some of the weeds are spreading, some have died.
        We have more need
         to take care here
                      or hide.
 Watch out! I slip, you scrape your knee, 
		it bleeds.
                        
  Against a steep rise, difficult rock face,
  some pain, much fear your sudden silence tells
                       ways must be tried 
                       from this hard place
                       or else
 For all at once, life's not all cut and dried.
                       
 The bleeding slows. I have you on my back.
  I study handholds, seeing lichens, granite blocks,
                        some ancient shells,
                        the green, blue, black
                        of rocks,
 with spells of balance, balancing of spells.

 Not certain, both our body weights combined
 of making headway here where rocks are steep
                        bruises and shocks
                        sharp pebbles grind
                        I creep.
 A new sound. A lone beast strayed from flocks.
                        

135
 A bleat, a movement, walking cloud of white:
 he knows the path. We are no longer stuck.
                        found by a sheep,
                        a welcome sight,
                        This buck
  becomes a friend we hope that we can keep.
                        
 He scrambles from us, showing us the way.
  Easy steps a passage I'd have missed.
                        A fast pace struck,
                        your clothes, new day,
                        The gist:
 we have some gods who care for us, or luck.

WHITE WATER

A Namakagon runaway canoe
racked up on rocks. A boy, then twelve years old
a boyscout, did no more than he was told
(Kid, get that paddle?) stepped in churning blue
-- the speaker teasing had not thought he'd do
the act -- the boy was swept off 
		thrown and rolled
came home with such a story to unfold:
words phrased as torrents 
		he had tumbled through

He could not tell enough -- a brownish grey
and metal-flavored memory would stay
to bruise -- years on -- a normal afternoon --
seen not unlike a distant half-heard tune
not recognizable but flowing still
as sung by his own ghost against his will.

FOLDING

The shepherds are meeting today -- need a meeting -- some bringing water
All day they have traveled, they come from the grasslands  leaving behind them
 Concerns for the safety of animals. 
		Now is time that they center.
Though lean tawny lions will feast on the flocks 		in untended pastures;
one sheep for each lion, a dozen perhaps or 			fourteen white victims
from hundreds, no thousands, of sheep on the 		hills and valleys of grasses.

The shepherds are meeting and they will need supper and sleep mats by  nightfall
for this they bring cheeses preserved from the milk of ewes in their keeping.
Green succulents wait for them -- gleaned for them -- over rocks and crevasses.

The shepherds will lie on their cloaks letting one small sunset amaze them
like ages of sunsets as evening calls them, 
		calls them away
to dream worlds of landscapes imagined, remembered, clouds of big wonder.                

138	 
The shepherds will rest and speak softly 
		reciting father-told stories
As heroes recount their grand winning with tears 		new tears for their losses --
tell also what foolish things they like young lambs have dumbly committed.

Light laughter will sprinkle the fire time to warm their flame-colored  faces
then coldness of star-smiling sky will remind them wrapped in their skins
to be fresh for the morning return to the normal silence of duty. 

139
COWS COME HOME

the shoe is stained
the jacket torn
the fingers aging into statue

a church tune
nasals in his head
having lost crescendo droning

he beats his hands together
stammering a pitiful condition
begging: cuppa cuppa 

unless one listens back
thirty years to hear the lost crescendo
he claps his hands to drive the dog

cuppa cuppa .. cuh baw  cuh baw 
"come boss, come boss"
in words as old as languages
old beyond all parthenons

MASK

because the kid without a mask was told
perhaps in earnest more likely though in jest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

at any rate his honest heart was sold
he was not of a mind to try a test
because the kid without a mask was told

if one can wait most aches and pains enfold
no more than time can slowly put to rest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

therefore forbearing years have gently rolled
still waiting for the time that is the best
because the kid without a mask was told

be patient and just wait be not too bold 
behave meet life as an invited guest
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

but explanations now do not unfold
not much can he of time or strength invest
because the kid without a mask was told
the problems all seem smaller when you're old

HOW TO SEE A ROCKPILE

These stones mark no one's grave--
		here they are piled
as if of no use, plowed up, thrown from fields,
forgotten. But accumulation yields
accomplishment, a direction wild,
unpatterned, not those educated rocks 
that are the skin of great cathedrals, spires
to skies, not even cornerstones to shops
When tourists chance  upon them, one inquires,
Then, are these forms of worship or great clocks?
No, just stones left where no one stops.
No Stonehenge, these, 
		no dolmen mystery shields
of culture long lost, undisturbed by child
for thousands of generations... A farmer's  mild
reaction to the difficulty of his fields. 

See this, a cleavis rusted now that tied 
his horse to wagon, this plain broken U
made his work possible,               
through little things it came together, 

Each horseshoe nail that helped the battle go.
 





146
HERITAGE

not a word, no not a sound
about the money let him bring it  up
that's how he gets attention
he thinks its him we want around
he carries on his little spats
I think I should just chuck it all
say how it really is with us
and let him will his wealth to cats

to cats and dogs he threatens to you know
he talks about his money leaving it
to charity who would think
that feeble body would go on and go
past a century without a sign
of ever freeing us of it
I'm seventy and carrying
this wasted man around this dad of mine

what I should do is drop him let him fall
the length of the  stairway tumble down
from step to step to hear me laugh
blessed relief to show him show them all
to lose so much that woman he called wife
mother to me god rest her soul
he never gave her much
neither a long nor a goodly life
death for her a well earned rest



147


he's lived without her five times longer
than they were with each other
those years were not his best


If he had died when she died
what a blessing what if she
had lived to see the years grow bright
her children strong in  wealth and pride
the awful lack of industry replaced
by healthy work her grandsons
working their women those who wanted jobs
have jobs with loveliness their lives are graced

no worries larger than a dance
or love affair which as you say
is worry large enough imagine
a concern for family size finance

LIGHTLESS

lightless
but not dark
a comfort 
all
is perfect
then 
in anguish torn

a wash
a gray-brown
metal-flavored fall
a memory
of being 
born

COWS


fence post
holds cows inside
farmer's pasture
no, wire holds them inside
no, barbs... no, intelligence

		THREE ACTS

Ginette had said the most disturbing thing:
"Guess what? Won't need this window when I'm dead"
"What's this? What put that notion in your head?"
"I'll walk through windows, see through walls. They'll
bring
My coffin here, I'll hop right out. I'll jump
On to your lap and you won't even know--
I'll snuggle close to you..."  "My God, my dear,
Must you go on!" I said.  "Oh, you  old grump..."
She called me that when she felt picked on. "Oh,
You grump!"  We said all this...  was it last year?
I wash this window, wash this window, bring
My chair to sit here next to hers--my head
Filled with one racking question: When we're dead,
Do we need windows?   ...walls, or anything?

WRENCH                                            

Gees, Mister, you didn't take much time
to fix the car.
How long, would you say?
The mechanic thought about the years of schooling
and a childhood around garages.
His tools, the hoist, the smells of oil,
little cuts that never quite bled
and never quite healed,
and black, always the black lines on him.
"How long?  Oh, about two arms and a wrench."

THE BIRDS


the birds are fighting again; friendly terms
I like to think, discussion fruit or worms
the blackbird chants his claim to own the tree
A martinet says lark, the rest agree
the robin hopes a vote will help decide
the bluejay swipes the prize he has no pride
when bigger birds engage in all this grief
the last wren hides behind a wren-size leaf
how much is  joy or play or pain or shame
for birdbrains working this skylarking game?
one more unknown--a great x to pursue...
which we must learn; it has so much to do
along with quasar quark and shooting star
with just what kind of universe we are

OLD RUSTED GATE  

On the old rusted gate
where we boys loved to wait
until Mildred or Annabelle called
'Get off that old gate
You have stayed out to late
And we know you are not Archibald.
 For when Archibald swings
on that gate little things
go pitter and patter inside
both our hearts but your swings
give us no fluttered pings
Still we swing on the gate
Perhaps someday our fate
Will bring us the prize of their smile
Unless Archibald cries,
'I will blacken your eyes
and swing you around in great style.'
Oh the old rusted gate
for me and my mate
is a place to hang out with our hope
But Mildred and Ann 
Want Archy or Dan 
or anyone else to elope
for they've known us too long as just boys
who make gestures and immature noise
They don't know how full well we'd make good
on our boasts, we're just kids from the 'hood
But one of these days
we will earn honest praise
at last we will be understood

                          now two beings
                       flow as one
                   child of our own love
Each twig of a tree
is a search for the upright
many paths to try
we now play splashing
                   tiny cataract of tears
where may month brambles scratch and creep
     play laughing exclamation
         look   I found one wet white stone
                                  perhaps an opal we
will keep

IS THIS HOW TO PEAL A POTATO
( see fandango )

Is this how to peal a potato
with bits flying madly about
juice squirted bits scattered
floor littered walls spattered
the others reply with a shout
this is not how to peal a  potato
with bits flying madly about

then is this how to peal a potato
so slowly so slowly with care
such a thin peeling
one must do this with feeling
but when would we get our share
this is not how to peal a  potato
so slowly so slowly with care

Is this how to fly like an eagle
by running pell mell in the breeze
until cleverly shifting
my weight I'd be lifting
myself off the ground with great ease
this is not how to fly like an eagle
by running pell mell in the breeze
you would crash if you happened to sneeze


157
say then how can I fly like an eagle
and become quite at home in the clouds
I'd like to be soaring
it never is boring
to be greatly admired by crowds
Oh you never can fly like an eagle
or become quite at home in the clouds

we have shown how to peal a potato
how dumb neckties all really are
we wonder what next
thing will find you perplexed
you really keep going too far

oh one additional favor I'm asking
 is this how to shine like a star?

LIGHTHOUSE
	
We'll have to raise the light above the trees 
so the foundering ship will come to us
her cargo splashing close 
so we can get it.
The sailors will be lost
as good as lost unless the poor souls think 
our wretched village better than what they left: 
stolen off a city street as boys
and put to work as men. 
otherwise we shove them out on rafts
let nature take its course.
	
A good part of our people
came here wretches off a ship,
no home to speak of... here we stay.
Now another crew comes floating in.
			
Once a crate of books washed up;
now what would this town do with books.
Bertie took them, said he'd like to try
to figure out some words. 
That made a joke for weeks around the town;
our tavern crowd can keep a good one going
quite a while.





159
	
We had him tear the pages out, make little boats 
to give him something closer to a job
than muttering to himself
about some marks smeared on a page.
We watched them--oh, a dozen at a time--
tossed on the waves, get water-logged, go down.
A few though would just float away.
You wonder where they'd get to.
	
One day Bert decided he'd find out,
went off himself just floated out.
	
We yelled,  told him the bore
would rip him off too far
to swim back in.  He floated off.
you think it may be that he got somewhere?

GRANT WOOD

What they can understand is what he'll be
That's good, they'll say, Another one of those.
He cannot show them what they do not see.

No prophet, only one who started free
but early learned obedience and chose
what they can understand is what he'll be.

For his own vision he will make no plea
as if what others know is all he knows.
He cannot show them what they do not see.

They have some forms with which  they all agree.
Each door to new adventure they will close.
What they can understand is what he'll be.

In his own mind range forms from A to Z.
Beyond the world their public thoughts explore
he cannot show them what they do not see.

They do not want a window or a key
so leaving them in self-induced repose
what they can understand is what he'll be.
He cannot show them what they do not see.

DEER    

When we saw her limping across the meadow,
White tail high, we knew then 
		that she was wounded,
Halting as she stumbled, fell down, unflagging
Probably dying

Shoot her, shoot her, that was the thought we 		shared then.
Hunters all, we knew where to center, focus:
Kill her kindly, quickly; then saw together
Fawn at the field edge

Watching, silent, taught not to bleat or whimper,
Yet a hunger held it. Now who had hunted
Here  (These fields, these woods 
were our father's homestead)
Hurting our nature.

When she reached the trees 
		for the young one nursing
Even as, while kneeling, she gave her life out,
We could only watch, we could take no action:
Mercy a poor word.
 





162

PROBLEM CHILD

I

We watch you walk into the room--sixteen--
somehow the world and you do not connect--
sixteen--afraid, alone, a problem child.
Your father willed to keep his living clean
and raising kids is messy--so, neglect.
The girls were easier--not half so wild,
then all that little league nonsense: compiled
for satisfaction of adults, adult respect.
Why bother.  Let them play sandlot; involved
without the father's time, and more 'correct.'
the mother not much loved, someone between
a servant and a mistress; life revolved
around a tavern; problems left unsolved,
so covered  up; now, you, you make a scene.



 










163

II

we watch you walk into the room white walled 
and you, white robed, to face the mirrored side
The nurse's aides come in with clips and ties
we are the mirror watching you installed
before what is to us a window wide
and open on you private unveiled eyes;
you think you are alone and no surprise 
announcement will inform you they have lied
as if enough books were not in your face
they wire you to graphs and charts besides;
we notice one part of your head is bald--
at least they'll read you only, there's no trace
of those dread dawn intrusions which erase
until whole yesterdays die unrecalled















164

III

we watch you walk into the room a pace
or two ahead of orderlies' machines
no one on earth will ever comprehend
how such machines can still be used to place
a judgment or prescription--what it means
is one great mask of numbers they can send
through more machines. Oh, God, I need a friend,  
--I meant to say 'you need' not 'I'--these screens
these screams around my and inside your head--
how is it such confusion intervenes?
We need to bathe you in one long embrace--
I mean 'you need'--that came out 'we' instead?
No chances anyway to get things said:
No human touch, just clip and tie and brace.













165

IV

We watch you walk into the room-- a bed--
at least it looks just like a bed--it waits.
They fool us though--they take you to a chair--
at least it looks just like a chair. You're led
to it, you're told to sit, you sit. Two plates
are taped and fixed to you.  You fix a stare
away from us, so anyway you care
enough not to look at yourself. That states
or seems to state... excuse me, you are full
of Pheno Barbitol Silicilate...
a self-betraying serum you've been fed.
so that this session for us won't be dull.
What circuses play within my--your--skull.
How foolish: what it states--cannot be stated.















166

V

we watch you walk into the room. You pull
the robes around yourself, sit down. The staff
arrives, attaches you by clip and wire.
Great rigging for a sail--your head a hull.
Now I can only be to you a photograph,
a three-dimensioned walking 'help-for-hire;'
Our relationship must not aspire,
for others love you.. even though by  half
not realized. ( God no ) to work for more
--think how this world has taught itself to laugh
--is to invite a crash.. ideas gull
and condor in the sky--crash on a shore
where small waves comfort, but the combers roar
to breakers and each minor splash annul.















167

VI

We watch you walk into the room, once more
must we intrude... too much is form, to close
this non-adventure we must finish that.
Think, think, someday we'll meet on some ground floor
with  no deceptive glass to interpose
a lie or lying in, no metal hat.
Imagine, a chance meeting, why we'll chat
completely free, to be where one leaf grows.
No sheets to write on or be boiled clean
'the form will, must be...' what?  no one as yet knows
white walls, white robe, white face, My God, what for?
Think, think ahead to when our right hands touch
in greeting--nothing big--and yet--so much--
the doctor's here--and look, his gown is green.

 

168

SENECA

We have an old guest coming, have you heard?
We speak of Seneca, a friend conjured
In our own garden, he will walk tonight
With me. I don't know how he comes. No  fright
Or problem is with him... says, "He who fears,
Serves," then tips his head, 
		waits for what appears
To be his wanting me to catch the sense,
The gist, of what he says. Alert, not tense,
As used to others who must take a while
To understand his words. A cautious smile...
	
What form is he in?  Well, I hardly glanced
At him... his very presence somehow entránced
Me so, I do not know.... I go again.
	
Oh, no, a skeleton?  So can all men
Who die and then return not wear some skin,
Be more presentable.  I'll wrap him in
A robe to hide his face... I mean his skull.
Yuck... neighbors... God knows who...their lives so small. Complain at each least thing they find. 
                                                  
Please sit, Dear Seneca, we'll talk as we commit
This interview...  Your trip from death... 
		You're cold?
Well, good, I meant this quilt to warm some old
Loved bones. Not quite like yours, I must admit;
But welcome, Seneca, 
169
                                I say, please sit.
You'd rather walk and talk? Of course, that's fine.
Here, in my backyard garden: columbine,
There, lilacs now in bloom... 
                 You haven't seen
Such elegance in yards?  Come now, you mean
You, guest of emperors...
		            What's that you said?
At dinner you admired the foods we had?
Far better than you've known. We live such great,
Uncomplicated lives? You think so? Wait!
I'll show you problems yet. 
			But, you go first:	
Tell me your thoughts, your plans. 
	                        ...Yes, I have thirst   
For many books. A score? Good grief, a score?
Why, say a thousand books, no, even more.
	
Too many, do you think?  I read too much?
You think that's possible? 
	                                Ah, to lose touch
With one's stability...  
				Too many trips?
That too?  Indeed, qualify... It's like the sips
That tease but do not quench.                      

		I would have thought
The more the better, sir; so I have bought
Books I will never read,  I would have said
More travel better than...
170
	             But you have had 
More opportunity, zipping about
In heaven, flying free...
	
                            I do not doubt   
A word you say, OK... you never fly.  
To stay at home is wise?  Where one must try
To take in one thought deeply, not skirt more 
Than one can understand, full of dark lore
Without the learner's light. As you can't read
All that you have, enough is all you need:
Have only what you read.   
			So much like Christ;
They say you do compare... 
			An overpriced 
Poseur?  Our Saviour?  You've talked, you two?
	
As everybody talks with You-Know-Who?
That's thrilling?  
			Dull?  
				Not dull; our Jesus? 
			Next
To God for conversation. 
				Much too perplexed?
 
Too much involved with saving those over-sexed
Or over-something sinners wrapped in crime.
So, you have talked with God?  



171		A waste of time.
Head-in-the-Clouds! 
			His head... 
                                                  it  is a cloud!
That I can comprehend. Uh, please... the shroud
Uh, please arrange the quilt.  That's fine. 
                                          What's clear	
Dear friend:  A grinning skull that gives no fear
Is friend indeed.
		Good-by, if you think
You really have to go   Stay for a drink?
No way for you to drink? Just ancient bones,
That's why you show distaste--those edgy tones--
When speaking about flesh and blood.  Your cause
Of death! That simple blood could flow, that laws
Bring such a bitter end,  I should have known.

But as you go, you promise to be back?
You have important knowledge that we lack,
And must be told, about the universe
From Eve and Adam, how they lived their curse
Into a legend honored with this earth,








172    

The sole exception: the place of birth
Remains a place we do not know... 

			So, then,
You promise we will  hear from you again:

Get drunk enough, you say. 
	This plum tree... 
			Where
Has he gone now? ...Into thin air. 


173

DEVICE  

my home computer isn't working

oh it's working
it has some wires crossed

no, the wires are where they belong
but you see

I see, 
that's a crosstalk problem
why we've had that
ever since the second telephone
was invented
you might say

you can fix it?

you need a crosstalk insulator

you have one?

oh not in stock

You can order one?

Let me check the catalog
I don't see
Oh, here
Only thirty-seven fifty
 
174

that will be great

they don't have them now
maybe when they re-tool
in the fall

then you cannot produce?

don't get huffy
what's the use

I  understand
but still
my lemonade
will be one quarter
melon juice
II
why don't you buy a new one
then you wouldn't be forever
patching, wiring, screwing
things together

there aren't any more
I can't afford it
the new ones can't be repaired
I'd be so poor  from buying new ones
every year a new one




175
everyone else has a new one

they are so poor from buying new ones
they can't go home at night
I can still go home at night
to eat a lemon
or a melon
I'm not sure which
the home computer 
has some wires crossed

you still should buy a new one
or not come around here any more

they're out of new ones

they picked up your old one
someone took it home
to make a lamp out of it

MOON

One evening I reach up to move the moon
just a little so the spread of light
avoids that spot of dirt upon the floor
not that I find so much about that dirt
be something I'd object to not at all
hmm, part of the reason is to  tease the cat

yes indeed the quick pounce of the cat
upon that spot of lucence from the moon
she always wants to chase to hunt for all
the moving objects even shapes of light
my motivation is to hide the dirt
not that it matters what is on the floor

what is important not this messy floor
not so much what's upset by the cat
and not a question of a little dirt
not even real concern about the moon
or whether I have something against light
no, for desire for something must be all










177

It's reaching out to have, to keep it all:
philosophy: ambition, build a floor
of consciousness a mental light
so bright that some attention to a cat
not staring like a bunny at the moon
or worrying about a bit of dirt

        	( the cat's conception is ignore the dirt )
	finding what it is that ruins all
	heroic efforts to be on the moon
     	to build ourselves a roof 
			four walls a floor
	with some provision to have food to eat
	along with a machine to make some light

	a safety measure; many times a light
	makes our lives easier... avoiding dirt
	is one of them with everything we eat
	but hardly ever do we think at all
	of what a night time shine 
			puts on the floor
	( for cat's sake, I reach up 
			to move the moon )

LETTER ON OLD LOVE

dear lover
know in closing
if you must
in eagerness
or carelessness
consume

our poorest warmth
this open daylight field

of our later years
bares
far too strong a yield
please
take me back
into the smaller room

our first home
dingy
hopeful in its dusk

before we'd grown
our garden
of distrust






179

no cable car for us
those shaky rides

a slower surer way
to race the tides

feel land-edge tremble
from great ocean swells



along the star-fished beaches
hand in hand

become sea creatures
burrow in wet sand

find driftwood
shining pebbles
and old shells
 
be eaten 
where our giant playmate
hides
 






180


FRIENDSONG

having not thought
about you for a while
and then thinking of you
all at once
is like sitting in a long program
in hot and stiff clothing
with my swimsuit on
underneath

and the  zookeeper comes in
and says
please come right away
the whales have been asking for you

BIOGRAPHIES

some days by morning burn off their strong haze
so early all their hangfire gold be gone
some blandly blue on blue end as they start
know little or nothing of wave or flame
cold sleeted skies as cold as gray on gray
or may yet serve a sunrise bright as down
a few bear storms that tear the land apart
leaving it never again the same

to draw a sixteenth century parachute
concentric sun waves or a starry night
or learn to win through those who persecute
or span the universe in mental flight

so do the great ones more great ones succeed
a lifetime of bright days on days to read











182    FANDANGO

Say then how can I fly like an eagle
and become quite at home in the clouds
I'd like to be soaring  it never was boring
to be greatly admired by crowds
Oh you never can fly like an eagle
or become quite at home in the clouds

We have shown how to peal a potato
how dumb neckties really are
we wonder what next thing will find you perplexed. 
You really keep going too far.
Oh, one additional favor I'm asking:
Is this how to shine like a star?

Is this how to dance the  fandango
with knees almost bumping the heart
magnified leaps almost dangerous sweeps
oh I feel I am coming apart
this is not how to dance the fandango
it's not hard if you know how to start

So is this how to dance the  fandango
with feather and cymbals and drums
I find this intriguing although so fatiguing
I just let myself flop as it comes
This is not how to dance the fandango
you will crash if you happen to sneeze.

SEEKER

A seeker after old things has descended
one hundred thousand years beneath his time.
Long chipping rock to sand-sized pieces 
		gives him
one tiny pointing bone he rests. The grime
and sweat have made a mask of mud.
He's worked all day.
He well deserves a moment's calm.
Once rock was clay 
once clay was flesh. The time reverses:
two are kneeling palm to palm.
The question, yes, the eon-welding  question 
between these two explorers must arise,
but how to choose the words 
		not spoil the moment
before this crack in time be closed. 
		He tries, he tries.

The question long in waiting: 
		have they painted yet
the antlered deer to seem alive
and leaping on our wall that magic
will bring food so we survive?
We do survive?

EL MIRADOR

  I have been chosen,   I at age sixteen
the Keeper of the Sun has sent a guard
to bring me to what no one here has seen
a busy place which is all house and yard.
This honor so esteemed for me--it's hard
to understand, accept.   I go alone.
the first step, the great road, all polished stone

They take me. Mother kisses, father hands
me things: corn, sack of beans. His eyes are wet.
That   I am chosen out of all these lands:
an honor he and   I will not forget.
Now my soul mother, who taught me,   I let
her hands dress me once more, 
		in feathered shells.
No longer simple, life in me foretells

Some act of greatness. Now, announcers shout.
The leader of the guard says "Time to start."
Sunrise it is, the guard and   I set out.
So proud   I am this day. Who wants my heart
Shall have it. and my strength, blood, part
Yes any of me, flesh or bone or thought.
More glory here than anyone has sought
 





185
We walk all day, next day, until five hours
past the second sunrise, skies in flame,
like flame too tree-high, higher, city towers.
Gods must have put them here. I cannot name
those gods; I only know why good rains came
and corn and sun, those gods.  
		Now awed but weak,
past ancient worded walls that almost speak.

Now closer to the towers, I see rich rooms,
and ruling places, stones for sacrifice
With high steep climbs. 
		Tall men wearing plumes
stand by me, take me. All gods have a price.
The body that was mine is theirs, is ice.
The Keeper cuts himself, stands high as sir.
Cuts tongue, an ear, and now; oh,no, look where.

Must he unsex himself? No, just three cuts
from which the blood now covers him, all red.
A field of people shout and cry. He struts
as I resume my climb, the guards ahead,
behind, to help. The Keeper close, not dead.
At last I stand where he stood. Cut, a stain
drips on me. Honored clothing gone. The pain.

TOUR A PARIS
I'm writing to you from a far far country
beneath a giant arch with arches climbing
to cross-hatched girders trestles singing skyward
tourists lenses guidebooks rise a thousand feet
I've ridden  up again and while descending 
A rebel patch of water draws my eye
from staring at the far-spread loving city
  I remember how you turned 
		to watch two children
splashing in the duckpond shrieks and laughter
the unmown grasses holding mothers watching
again   I see them play and   I remember
how you marveled turning from this tower
for time to see this picture this reflection
this hidden water wild with ducks and splashes
I'm writing to you from a far far country
another autumn since we came together
discovering in one Parisian courtyard
a smiling lady old dressed all in black
she sat alone with two chairs 
		one for bread crumbs
she coaxed some birds to eat. 
		We stopped you counted
seven sparrows perched  upon one hand.
She busy did not notice that we noticed
how her lifetime focused on the feeding
to touch a wildness still within her reach. 
Again I come remembering you counted 
seven sparrows feeding on one hand
while others fluttered winging fussed. Somehow
she talked them into waiting   I am waiting.

TAKING THE HOME APART

packing into bales, the poles in pairs
with a short traverse lashed
the bales lashed to the poles
on the blankets a seat arranged
for a grandmother
ties and hooks for piling tools kettles 
all  the baskets the wonderful, beautiful baskets
the poles as thiles lashed to horses for the journey...  where can we go 
who will give us river prairie 
		let us keep our horses
someone lurks along our trail
to take our horses blankets
someone comes to take our prairie
tell us to move on onward is backward
all our trailing is a downward 
falling into ruin until in the darkest forest
of our wander waits to take our children
child of radiance who was
grandmother's promise and fulfillment
dance upon her grave
for she is finished and complete
her being now a circle you have rounded
dance upon the ashes of her fires
She leaves you warm
Where is the child who was born 
		to sing her name

SEASONS BLEND

We ski on rhododendron petals spray
a snow of pink blue green as season blends 
with season, overlay of days on day;
New Zealand Alps, Swiss Eucalyptus, trends 
our dreams take, memories a cluttered drawer
disordered needing albums all about
a cubist near-clarity restore
sense with the photographs that you take out

what year it was this happened 
        when was that
not nearly so important 
as that now
what is adventurous 
we may find new
and old at once 
only a change of hat
or scarf to move 
into what times allow
us: happy days 
that we do and re-do

VIBRATIONS

Vibrations all around us live and strong
we were the ones who heard and kept the beat 
with rhythms of the hopes the words repeat
a lifetime and each moment capped with song
if in the day to day the words went wrong
we found comfort in the music we heard sweet
but that unheard was...  
		something penned by Keats
with harmonies we have remembered long

Publicly the wonder of the seeds
speak to a world in paradigm 
in metaphor of how things ought to be
privately we share our secret needs
so when the massive echoes of the hymn
have faded; Piper, pipe a song for me.

WILLOW FENCE POSTS

The farm   I visit now has one old barn
that   I remembered was about to fall, 
cave in from age, worn out by time and wind,
when  I last saw it years ago. It stands
now as it had stood then, sway back, a threat
to any neighbor kid who thought to climb
to rotting rafters now too dangerous
for ten-year-old explorers biking free.
The house itself, still lived in, with a fresh
and shiny layer of tarpaper siding
is warmly lit inside by modern means
where once a single kerosene lamp burned:
a midget wick of slight illumination.
  I open my car door to step...and then
  I see them, trees that have been growing all
these years, and dying too; a give and take
of life and death. Small branches newly green
rise high and on the ground a tangled death.
The neighbors who had lived here built a fence
with willow posts to hold barbed wire. The posts,
because they were black willow, then made roots
and twigs and so set out to reaffirm
what they might have to do 
		with woods and farms.

I'll tell you, ideal reader,
of your future

You walked in me when I was fog and freezing
you stayed when I was glacier-lost but strong
you moved with me 
		when I was spring and fountain
when I raged breaking 
		maelstromed over cliffsides
you clung, 
you clambered through me 
inside backwashed caves and courses.
Know then we meander natural but tame 
our bedway smoother every turn 
past marsh  and grassland...
wait,
the tide-bore churns, new channels are cut out through the blinded delta we will see 
before we finish 
we respond to moon and sun

wear tough leather brogans
with two-buckle rubber overshoes
Soil will leech the leather
so the two layers bought separately
are never taken apart.

The shoe will bear the strength
to break the sod, to break a horse,
to tramp into a swamp
to find a cow
gone off alone for giving birth.
Stop where the cow is licking
pick up the calf
the mother goes on licking
the belly of the calf
the leg of the calf
the arm of the man
who crouches crouches low
so the rasping and caressing tongue
can reach the calf
as they travel up the slope
the pain of crouching
travels up the leg
across the back
along the arm
the mother licking
they bring each other to the barn

TRAVELING LIGHT
	Upon retirement

To my last students, with so much to live,
Not too much baggage would I have you carry
Through fifty years, but one help would I give--
Not too exact, (who sees the future clearly?)--

A word or two--and surely not my own--
Experience from someone not returning
With sense enough that through each year has grown
In wonderment to value  what he's learning.

By word or painting, any form of art,
Dear student, take on statements found imbedded
In what you see and hear, that sound from heart
and mind and help confirm which way  you're headed.
That touchstone to strong life will ring with right
And as you travel, pick up rings of light.

surprising 
the reds and purles 
of so many idle sticks.

Over all this color and re-color
the cluds have snow in them

WORDS TO A PLANT

How have  you been,
Greensleeves
You've had water, old Barkfingers,
Good soil around your roots,
well-potted, Sun-Reacher.

Time, blush, to flower
maybe seeds, huh?
I'll bring a butterfly
or a bee, Twig-Rustler.

This spring, I'll see to it
that you have a nest,
not a robin's nest, 
built in a week, a throw-away.
Oh, no, an oriole's nest,
that marvel of a purse they weave.
I'll get you one, if I have to go
without theater tickets,
or give up ice-cream like for Lent.
A guy needs a friend
and Plant, with your second flower
if it comes I'll make tea
a superb infusion to drink
wth carckers from London
with cheese from Finland,
and upon the window.

FAMILY OF A LOST CHILD

We keep the light on hoping his return
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.
a simple opening, our lives so torn
the slamming door, soft voice, "Hi, folks, I'm back."

He was a child we knew could well attract
the troublesome attention, hard to learn
that innocence can meet such dread impact.
we keep the light on, hoping his return

will bring the joyful peace so hard to earn.
His father seems to have his life intact:
few know it is pretense.  His real concern
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.

Too many years already, odds are stacked
against the missing boy.  They tried to warn
us all, that we, in truth, should not expect
a simple opening, our lives so torn,

his mother goes to meetings, her eyes burn
with tears--are all the suspects tracked?
Her project is a stronger way to mourn;
she knows she will not hear:  "Hi, folks, I'm back."

TATTERED WALLET

He took his tattered purse in hand,
the picture of his favorite nurse,
he did not see it land
upon the counter, understand
he does not see too well.  Soft curse
in ancient accents sharply terse
he utters, looking for a bill to pay
the grocer; then, to reverse
the lonely shaded way
to home...across the bridge
as added years disperse
his strength, until the last ride
which all others but rehearse.

PUZZLE WORDS

A sharp stinging flavor, a cane,
a very large string, a floor of a ship,
the buried lline of a precious metal:  
he agonised over the remaining clues
to the Sunday crossword puzzle.
suddenly he stood up as the tart odor
of fresh blueberry pie reached his nose.
He grabbed his walking stick, flung the honors
rope over his shoulder, ignored the solitaire
deck strewed behind him, and began the grand march,
not feeling the weak spot in his blood vessel
give way in the last fatal struggle
of a vein to hold itself together.

They cannot float at sea
with all its hopes and fears;

they dare not come to land
as firm as that appears:
this world is of a size
for those like you and me.

But each one hundred years--
oh, maybe two or three--
one giant gets to stand
inside one human's eyes.

CARS

Cars in the parking lot  do not sleep,
thumbs of light off glass and chrome
stab into offoces amd classrooms
studying shoulders, backs, and necks:
people are delicious,
cars have recipes.

Welcoming the people
who crawl willingly
into over-cushioned stomachs
to hide what they will do;
some slowly disappear
a satisfying meal.

Waiting for the people
who morning come in busily
who evenings go out tiredly
degested into systems
of petroeum and steel.

Watching for the people
so buckling steel can masticate
the gentleness of arms and legs
that will no longer feel.

Cars in the parking lot do not sleep
patient in their hunger they watch all afternoon.




217



OM

to say a name 
to say to say
a  name
until the word is something
more than name
the sound
the sound
repeating of that name
until the thing is found 
that is the name

the word
unheard
the contemplated name
the call 
the all in one
the toral name
the plea the sweet persuasive
signal name
but more
and more than any other
name





218
NO ROOM

No room for one more photograph; these walls
are full. no frame can hold a picture quite so small
that it would fit within the space between
one image or another. All these rooms
are taken and the house will have no more.
I must go on to find outside a place 
to nail my thoughts or give creation up.

The galleries are ready for  a younger voice
the ticket buyers ask which ones are new

The faces that look at me /wink and/ laugh
these faces I had loved and now I half
remember or some not at all

The walls have no more room
for painted images or photographs 
the years have been too good
remembrances that leave out
grief and sad encounters
edge each other for attention








219



Once  upon a time a prince
decided he could travel to the stars
( It hasn't happened since;
we have  not even gone to Mars. )

NOW

think only of the now
within that small parenthesis
explodes eternity




DAY AND NIGHT



if day must arrive
keep it gradual
so the dreamworld fades one bit
then another

my two lives need
pillows between each other
cushions to comfort the rocks
something with feathers








221
BEFORE NAMES 
                        
once there were  no names
for the earth's 
uncountable things
and acknowledging that only a few things
have acquired names
after all these gifted lives piled on determined lives

before anything was named
powers of magic electrified 
sinews and roots

none of this separation into classes
categories species platoons genuses
all was one great surge of feeling

a dark stranger shuffled by with tags
cracks appeared in the fleshberg of creation
words put a difference into existence




222
BORN

If I am to be born again
I d like to be the favorite son
of a tribal chief
who owns the overhang
of a cliff where we all live
catch as catch can

except that if I can
order about the others again and again
decide even if one should live
or die for I am the chosen son 
of so many sons my father can hang
with any mothers for he is the chief

if I was born again that way my chief
interest would be interviews can 
anyone listen enough get the hang
of one person after another listen again 
to dream and fear of daughter and son
how they live and wish that they could live

I said before I want to decide if they live
but could not bear the power to be chief
when I said I want to be the son
I meant to include that's all I can
ever be so let me begin again


223


tribes mostly don't do a cave an overhang
is a safer cleaner better place to live
to carry on and hope to live again
even if not the favored son of the chief
another life and another all one can
or needs to  hope for even a son

or dauhger daughter or son
redo youth dread and  joy rage and hang
around with friends i  hope i can
spend at least one more span to live
to listen son of a chief
if ever i do get to be born again.

rather than ask for heaven with a pillow
and blanket and pudding and leaves
all turning color and falling to lie
for long enough to rot after turning brown
i ll spend my time in gratitude
for that one life i got to have.


224

I've  had a thousand listeners stay on
while I could write:
perhaps this life of mine
already is a heaven
some poor wretch
has struggled  to deserve

DANS MON JARDIN

La rose a peur

c'est une petite soeur
c'est amateur rëveur

j'arrive le professeur

impossible qu'elle exprime
que tout ce que je fuis

( FANDANGO )

Then Angeline came to the rescue
she was bright she was light she was grand
with a dance that was pure Abaresque
she knew how to wait how to stand
this is not yet a true old fandango
for that you must have a small band

but she danced what she could
with what music
the family could find close at hand
a kettle, a stick, and a bouncing 
soft ball and a soup of popular brand

if this is not quite a fandango
it's as close as you're likely to get
so come now grandfather and dance this
you must not just rest when you're set
get up on your feet give an elbow
and feet then a hand bend a knee
yes that's good you bet
stay away from the pots on the table
or we might all go home soaking wet.

LAST    WILL

statement and a word that I avoid
a will: strange double word
what I will will not much:
a house: by others more possessed
while I: body and soul employed
a forty-year profession: little incurred:
or now impossible to touch
whoever was the most impressed
the most impressionable among
all takers are the most far-flung
little left behind for me to leave behind
the less to give the more enthralled
the more the value the less to find

statement: with a strange insistence
all that matters must remain
at home but always cropping up exceptions
old papers a box of tools 
favorite books for instance
impersonal but with my life's blood stain
who takes in such collections
we follow time-fixed rules
if not betrayed by that assigned
legal legal but uncalled
for  'being of sound mind'
now for a notary three friends
and time for taking care of ends.

. INTRODUCTION TO UNWRITTEN POEMS

the choice of words is not too difficult
once one decides where sense and symbol lead
whole paragraphs can almost write themselves
as word on word as letter follows letter
to the page. The problem is to find
not which idea patterns a result
but how such effort fills somebody's need.
So many books need trashing, now on shelves
not worth the trouble someone said it better
lines must instruct not idly fill the mind
as well as stand up to those at the loft
the English language, mighty in its powers,
the quick bold stride, the clash, the march to war 
the stately force in old iambic embers
that smolder, flare, where epic echoes lie
what each child being read to hears remembers
while ancient sounds resound in his reply
but warm endearing phrase enfolding soft
these loving movements not so much were ours
the Whitman words young poets angle for
to build today a language bravely new
uncounted cadences that find their way
unrhymed but balanced lines exactly tuned
to swallowed screams dark mirrors down a hall
to private tremblings to each household wound
in here we've heard how that is nothing small
that the direction in its work its play
sense intimate, words natural, lives true.

ALPHABET
the O is first
a rank above all others
holding its simple surprise

then is S
wanting to strike
or warn about striking
not merely to pluralize

M
perhaps is first after all
taking the least effort
a vehicle for music 
and for seeming wise

E
a set of shelves
hanging around all over
most unique and useful
when silent

And so it goes
the alphabet all wrong
All the orders
in the encyclopedium
all the seating charts
in the classes
telling people
who gets to sit
in the back of the room

230





SONGBIRD

the songbird in the tree
would have us all believe
that he is doing nothing
he is listening to the mountain
telling him  where South is




GARDEN


to follow garden pathways
all around delights
of tripping songs
we learned from mothers 
with words
longer than our days
before we tired of gaming
so gave back songs to birds
so gave back love to flowers
which have that alone to do

FIGHTING THE LOSS
( an archeologist finds a tiny 
fertility goddess long buried )


Antique respect for hope and birth
perhaps a symbol of the wise
at any rate it has lost the worth
and calm clear light behind the eyes


the legs are smooth
smooth too the bust
above it is rough

this tiny size
demanding love
and more
demanding trust


what has been lost
oh what a storm
of promised pulse
of swell and thrust
we do not even care
now form
is all, is all. 




234

TRIOLET  2

after the robin song
there in the green ash tree
nothing can be wrong
after the robin song
however the day seem long
I sing also am free
after the robin song
there in the green ash tree




235

TRIPLE S  

I lie upon this earth
possessed
by rock by swamp

I give my warmth
to this absorbing ground

I close on death
I dart

I put my body
into soil
in trust to water 
loved by working air

I think of grapes
of yellow
bells
of leaves
I gather growths of stem
to myself

Left open
to a life I crave





236
 

a gasping flame
may eat the rain
I am not strong
or brave

Shaken from home
and bed all whimpering

wild wild
to stay
I can walk
one breath of time
solacing and deep

but I cannot decide
that I decide
that is a counsel
someone else must keep

A snake in triple S
writes my name 
in script the flighted redowl
in gawping dives
through clouds  
pretends
to read




237

  
to bring
to striding guardians
a thirteen striped 
flapped parchment
to be signed 
with
sticks
that bleed

SARAI

how do stories get so wild
one crazy distortion piled
upon another
I at ninety years
in spite of aging tears
was told yes told
to have a child 

grandchild more likely
what to suppose
just to make it readable they chose
to let the ridiculous tale skip
a generation
big male ego trip
what could I do
except to  help him count his toes

hug him as real mother 
all the great
male problem solvers of all time and fate
forget the  diapers 
or swaddling clothes 
perhaps
a warm and learning little one 



239



on loving laps
did those men even think about 
our strength her care

as grandma 
that's my non historic role
while grampa 
his own fake fatherhood extols
sounds off intelligent 
on universal ills
like all men 
while the women pay the bills
and worlds spin on 
to blast their lying souls

of all the old-fool tricks 
this fictioned dad
was to believe: 
an angel told him that he had
been truly father, 
biological oh laugh
so many years since he could raise a staff
I'd scorned him out of bed.






240


This half grown lad
the grandchild god-child lovely, 
raise a hand
against this fairest of our tribe, 
yes a command
came into his confuddled brain, 
so blurred
so grateful am I that I heard
got dressed in angel clothing 
found out where to stand

so just as he was wild enough to stab
this almost man I had to grab
his feeble arm 
and in false angel tones
tell him he proved his point 
on stones
he fell 
and peed upon himself, 
a jab

from me 
got him backup while Isaac held
him... 
let him think he had excelled

241


you've won 
I had the presence to announce
so once again 
the two males could pounce
upon each other to embrace 
you've won 
I yelled

you proved your absolute obedience
he actually believed it all, 
so dense
he is... 
he told me to my face
how he was victor for the human race
he was so proud 
gone far beyond all common sense














242
WHO

Who was I
that all this cosmo
                      logical
fuss
goes  on
to save my soul

or not
that mind
goes
withershins
upon a whirlwind

of flame


243
FOUNDERS' VISION

The pathway leads
beside the river
where brambles tear
the ground
where water seeps 
makes each step
mindless
of its own direction

somehow
I move against the river
to see
far off
across a grid of thorny branches
the feeding ponds
with tended poles
from which
the lamps of Eden
shine a music
for the families
who work
the rafted gardens.


244


CAMPING

I walk the trail
a furrow-length
into the woods                       

a birch tree
fourteen thumbs across                       
at one knee-height
a single touch-me-not
golden under clouds

a popple
the top half 
hanging from a stump
my reach
and half my reach again
high
I look closer
it is Balm of Gilead

I brush a fern
a plastic drinking cup

I am one-eighth
of a mile
out of town



245

EN ESPANOL

She stood upon the city square, she knelt
To travel that whole distance on her knees
To demonstrate the piety she felt

The stones were rough, unswept; an unhealed welt
On one knee bled.  To catch a bit of breeze
She stood up.  On the city square she knelt,

Continued on her prayerful way, strong-willed,
Across the pavement, hoping pain would please
To demonstrate the piety she felt.

The ones she loved had been so much at fault--
Grandchildren, nephews--burdens she might  She stood
up on the city square. She knelt,

Two blocks to go. She would absolve their guilt,
Do anything to help--as faith decrees--
To demonstrate the piety she felt.

For this a great cathedral had been built,
One spire three hundred feet above the trees.
She stood upon the Zocalo, she knelt
To demonstrate the piety she felt.

Worse than rhyme  iv

I roam
Take lots of room
A belly full of rum
And riding on my mental rims
Dodge! Ram!

WHEN GOD IS READING OUTLOUD TO YOU

When God is reading outloud to you
the voice may be any voice
but always absolutely in control
of its own timbre
it's own tenor
it's own timng
unless
the story grows into a frumpy animal alive
crawlign byitself  to denouemen
then evneGod is not predictable
then even god gets excited
the voice  trembles
excitement rises
for the cimbing sequence
the voice falters
changes from one voice to another
Not knowing what the pitch should be
the power of delving
the patience for the characters
to talk on quietly talking
knowing all along that the voice 
that longs for recognition
needs only to wait
to keep on growing
but to hear again
to mouth the very words
so many times repeated
but each time


248

getting the words better
fixing up the sound
letting the phrasing become more natural
easier
and make the words with you own mouth
of suffereing of coubt
of slowly clearing ingorance
knowing beter all along but required
by circumtance
to strugle phase to new phase
light spot to simple eye
touch recoil to loving hugs
to live again the bbarely beginning
stretch toward daylight
over and over relive
the warning call
because the wondering question
when God is talking outloud to you
every time
it begins again
and every time
the process gets finer
but slower and the pains and pleasures multiply


249

When God is reading to you
in the birthing pain
of new reaches
in the bandage lifting pain
of new discovery
laying open new layers of knowing
the sheer silent screech
becoming bright and soothing
courage self molded from despair
Going on again into the next chapter
aches and hurts not understood
deep throbs awakening to feelings
sentiments 
each repetition 
everything is shorter crisper
more aware.




250
                      STORM


I
you listen as the windows shake
harder than you've heard before
The panes, you wonder, will they break

Again that sound, Wind? Nothing more?
A coldness coming in the door
You listen as the windows shake
 
Again the sound, wind, nothing more?
Are you the only one awake
Is something blowing off the lake

Again that sound, wind? Nothing more?
you listen as the windows shake
will what is blowing reach the shore

Again the sound, wind? Nothing more?
What does the morning hold in store
You listen as the windows shake.

II

 You slowly walk among the trees
you hear no sound you feel no breeze
Where nothing grows in this dark shade
no petal shines, no merest blade
you slowly walk among the trees
where nothing grows in this deep shade
the bushes hide a sound that flees
here nothing grows in this deep shade
you slowly walk among the trees
is there a sound, you are afraid
where nothing grows in htis deep shade
wtih mossy softness to your knees
advancing on, armed with a spade
you slowly walk among the trees.

I'm walkng down a country road
to visit my big sister's niece
this  puts me in a frightened mode
old gravel slippery as grease
this truly is a tricky piece
I'm driving down a country road
old gravel slippery as grease
the engine steams and may explode
the mud builds up an overload
old gravel slippery as grease
I'm driving down a country road
where lonely dangers will not cease
old gravel slippery as grease
I'm so alone a startled toad
and overhead a V of geese
I'm driving down a country road

253

how like a new and strange disease
you spend a lifetime to forget
it  overtakes you like a sneeze
the body pays this years old debt
more evidence now, on it weaves
it's like a new and strange disease
my body has this years old debt
the aged are so hard to please
the geese have broken their high Vs
my body has this years old debt
its like a new and strange disease
no use to worry so and fret
my body has this years old debt
now adding up in vain decrees
time and I we've scarcely met
it's like a new and strange disease

GRANDEE

I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
broad black hat and a polished cane
arranging careful each catch and drape

nothing is more important than an outward shape
a shining buckle and a silver chain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape

A mourning color, heavy voile or crepe
a distant love guitars a heart's refrain
arranging carefully each catch and drape
I love to watch the grubby neighbors gape
carefully avoiding any smudge or stain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape

all held together by the pins and tape
hooks are extra at the points of strain
arranging carefully each catch and drape

especially flattered when those lessers ape
proud and elegant--just short of vain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
arranging carefully each catch and drape

ELDER HOSTEL

Sunset after all day blended light
has hidden gold, strong yellow, orange red
shatters whiteness on the crest of night
hot colors blazing on their own death bed

autumn crowned in universal green
a neutral hiding flashings in the leaves.
consumed to show so lavish but unseen
rich colors day of cooling strength receives

lifetime, sober, dutifully spent
and hiding brightness, now from structure 
intoxicated, what had old rules meant
espressions flung, sky falling fires born

the seasoned systems work with age-free prime
true colors that have been there all the time.












256


NEIGHBOR

Why never in our passing do we talk
about a feeling or important thought
good morning is enough or how you are
followed by a meaningless just fine
I see in your east window blush to see
so turn away I must not let you know

that I have spied not even though we know
your private action could not cause the talk
that would embarrass it's all right to see
you washing dishes, what  a silly thought
that watching you at tasks is not a fine
allowed discovery of what you are

to that extent, so later, when we are
both workng in the yard, I say you know
these irises of mine would look so fine
if some were spread in your yard, idle talk
but carefully disguising any thought
that your life might be something I should see

I bring a picture over so you see
how shyly delicate the colors are
in answer to my statement that's a thought
you calmly say as if you did not know
some hope of recognition in your talk
behind my try them they will do just fine

257

is not of flowers only, waving fine
and waiting for a blossom season: see
such blue and white.. I would do more than talk
for in your eyes how haunting colors are
perhaps not loving, admiration, know
that you are lovely--just a thought.

So when you bring a chair you say  you thought
that I might fix yes, glue will make it fine
as good as new, but wait, how did you know
I do such things you tell me you can see
through my west basement window how there are
my piled up projects so we laugh more talk.

With one thought leading to another, may we see 
that  getting close we know share trust, talk
Fantastic are romances we refine. 
 
258
STAGES

Imagine stepping through one door
and then another each one leads
to one more grandiose room
until you reach a single place so large
that you are lost
so lost you cannot stay there, not return

so many forces work preventing your return
no way to find the door
definitely lost
Path and hedge-side nothng  leads
away--forever to remain at large
what  blessing that the whole world is your room

at last you find your way into a room
one season smaller now you can return
to find again what seems no longer large
follow footsteps anything door afer door
to rooms with gardens one step leads
into a space to  keep you..unlost.

FORGETTING

The places I remember far away
The places I remember that are near
All memories I lose each passing day

What was that lighted town, a bright display
Sky-high, it was? or so it did appear. 
The places I remember far away

Where was that town they couldn't let us stay
They had a festival tat time of year.
All memories I lose each passing day

Who was that friend who taught us how to say
the foreign phrases we found so hard to hear.
The places I remember far away

A frame with  nothing in it, gone what may
More than regret, the emptying I fear
All memories I lose each passing day

I want back all that brightness gone to grey
Whole reaches of a life no longer clear.
The places I remember far away
All memories I lose each passing day

Growing Up

incredible that son of his could be so tall
now needing a pair of dress trousers
good enough for the formal dance
more incredible that this creature
of stream and brushland
was letting himself be fitted
into such civilized apparel

How does it happen, this child
could put on adult disguise
be so debonair
bouncing between heaven and earth

 POTATO JUICE

Potato juice
you'll never be able to sell potato juice
like to drink you mean
dispensers come with four spigots
and even to add water 
you have to run in an extra line
the stores are full of varieties of drinks
potatoes are used as chips fries
but juice
that's like trying to sell tomato chips
no it's not a great idea
i said that to show you how ridiculous
no you can't use my name
you're fighting all the customs
all the rules of food
that people are used to
potato juice and tomato chips are absolutely
impossible
the sexy odor
ok
but that doesn't mean
people will want to drink it
wear it maybe


262

potato perfume
I didn't mean to 
I was just trying to stop you from
no potato perfume won't sell
yes, it's sexy
but
as cologne
try Pop's Schnapps
oh I didn't mean that
no you can't use it
on Spud's duds
forget it
please just go on marketing your chips
and fries
will you that's enough
you want to go into the perfume business
no I don't think someone else will take the idea and
run with it
no you can't say
beauty is in the eye of the potato
the eye of the potato
is used to start a new plant
it isn't any special product
it's sort of like a belly button
just a hole






263

no you can't grow a new person
that isn't what I said
I know how to grow a new person
potato juice won't help
potato eyes are a method
for non sexual reproduction
potato sculpture 
grow those knobby potatoes
you get that by letting them dry out
part of the season 
from lack of rain
before irrigation
you can't control that
you think you can inject water
I wonder if people could take potatoes
that seriously
funny shapes
comic sculpture
red brown russet
round and oblong
Idaho doesn't mean anything
they just brag about them to sell them
any other state does as well

    

264


Potato Cream Pie
potato relish
that's possible
that's the best idea so far
in fact it's the only one worth
no
I'm not going to listen to this
yes
people have always used potatoes
as stoppers on gas cans
but
a good filter yes
deodorant yes
but no
I dont want to hear what potato pads
would be good for
I don't want to hear all the uses
I'm not listening

JACK

( the poem I wrote
while trying to write
ALEXANDRINE  )

the tallest horse we ever had was Jack
in thirty years he did his share of pulling
he went to the ground
while I was leading him, a high perched crow
announced alarm. Jack slipped to sleigh-packed snow
I'd heard his heavy breath as we'd come back
his head was dropping, wide eyes dulling.
the crow's one sound.


he lies there, I go to the stall
I clean it with the fork that has five tines.
I hear his breathing
I angry point a mullein at the tree
in rifle style; the black one does not see
or thinks I clown reutters his one call;
about Jack's head in frost-drawn lines
a cold cloud wreathing

266
now other duties call me from the Belgian
filling dumping attic bin and cellar
could he not die
be some forever horse to thrill our race
like those from Marly now on Concord Place
like those that London gained from righ Lord Elgin
like that of him who drew us a propeller
would not tell why


that proud one never metalled from the vision
nor born from burial thirty feet to rise
above the crowd
like in Geneva the Unridden Horse
( of histories that chariot our course )
through corridors of circles or collision
of blues that love the yellow's red surprise
( If that one be allowed )


267

at least this faithful horse has not been led
to battle whimpered hurting to the ground
bewildered frightened 
betrayed in far off angry man-made thunder
I sit beside the unfamiliar head
the crow informs the world with his one sound
the breath has tightened.

At least this horse has not had that to fear
as naked in obedience yet willing
dutiful if not bold
Like boys, eighteen, who, soldiered far,
must question when alone where is the star?
Horrible to think, as beasts endear;
Red bubbles in the nose the belly spilling
the senses cold...

Jack on his side his unshod feet now writing
gigantic arcs upon the crusted snow
New struggle? Old adventure?
A dream he skids ghost logs on lost woods trails,
or, provident pulls yet as  his strength fails?
breathing almost done, the great eye fighting
the flighted sentinel--well-ended, so,
our mutual indenture.

BIRD IN RAIN

so often in the rain a bird sits still
to wait for sunshine, or a worm to show
she fluffs her feathers for a cooling grace
sometimes one bird of birds in a line
will drop, some force has come to kill
her deep inside, or it is time to go
the other birds move in to fill that space
they wait some more at last a day's sunshine
means they fly off, at work they do not know
one of their number leaves without a trace
that later time allows some gross divine
exert a detumescence at its price:
wide circles, circles, mark a bird's decline
with built-in wobbles, round with sun and rain.

The carcass of the horse we do not bury;
it makes the fading processes go slow.
A log of old
we'll skid him, then forget where he is laid;
so stumble on clean bones next August's shade.
Then Jack will play my Yorick, not so merry.
"Come home, it's almost dark and time to go.
Come home, we do not hide him from the crow.
Come home... it's cold."

LAST DAYS

in that strange
circumstance
we did not know
was coming
where are the sign posts
those shouting billboards
of wise or wise intended
but not wisely

hold my hand
for we must be
together
through this tunneled nighttime
we have wanted
not to end
as we had wanted
never to begin

it did begin
in spite of our desires
in spite of all 
we thought that we had done
to keep it all all right
and it will end 
end soon

BLUE BIRD GUITAR

the book has fallen
from his hand
as under a November sky
unseasonably warm
an afternoon goes by
on its perch
inside the ornamental crab
a bluejay is alerted
from stops and starts
of brakes too shrill
of the approaching mailman's cab

the bird flies down
beside the man who has lain so still
the wild bird thinks him safe
double error
lands on the guitar
the strings sound
to the bird's and man's surprise
one awakens to where they are
the other wonders what they've done

the mail
time to slowly rise return
dear occupant
you have already won




273

to know who lives here really?
possibility remote
with which he hasn't time to dwell
the book left in the wind
changes chapters
willy-nilly page by page unread
it's just as well

he's almost missed the smallest envelope
no doubt of which loved child it's from
dear uncle
less involving than the telephone
he'll return a kindly note
easy to send cash but that's not done
--leave them on their own
plantings won't survive too long
 in spring initiation hats
so one career at college is put off
an extra year or two more means
no one sorry glad if anything
the high coursed phase of life 
can slow
the nephew needs no debts
so let it go
enjoy the youth's discovery 
of what old age forgets

274

the ads    the best no comfort
and the least no stress
imported letters to the wrong address
the book the last page turned
has closed itself as if aware
the wind selects leaves
in the garden
working toward the winter's lying bare

a magazine invites a hope
for a refreshing crumb
short story little captured skit
a cartoon with the hand of love
behind its touch of wit

across the yard the neighbor
has grown children every week
give time to him
well, not to him, but to the house and garden
keeping trim

they have no time to stay ahead of chores
no listening then to how grass or a tree
takes care
the civilizing touch
they help each other to remember
common lie
the way it used to be



275

when he can't do his own
he'll hire the work
nephews if they choose
but limited to short chance visits
delighting in them
he will not abuse
obedience soft eyes bright skin
those past all childhood even
the promised waiting of the boys
the waiting promise of the girls
where time can never win

his wife retrieves
the fretted instrument
the bird returns inside the tree
a skittered leaf stays busy at its task
the dust across the garden swirls
and dances with a question
no one turns to ask.

PATRIMONIAL
	
My father's lantern
       swinging in his hand
	cast shadows
	      as he walked
		across the snow
		      each step
			went over hills  
                                         forever                                           
                              
My father saw his children
       leave the farm
	one by one
	       like harvest times
		  that cropped
		       his loves  
                                         his lives

My father's one regret
      when his last autumn came
	he could not finish
	      digging
		the potatoes
		     and it was
	                         a good year  
                                       for potatoes

MONET

he had built a pond
within his garden
where shaded leaves float 
dappled on the stream
and as he built a bridge
across the inlet the pond 
became the center of a dream

again he builds rebuilds
the pond with willows
he often builds the bridge
that arches there the willows 
reach to touch the water surface
colors ghost and mingle in the air 

he has given of his garden
all the sunlight worshipping
the long rays
he has lost
to find himself
reborn to flowers
to water
new forces
only painting 
will exhaust

278

again again
he builds
rebuilds
his garden
a clarity
like madness
he possessed
again again
he builds
rebuilds
the garden
the vision 
of a blindness
haunts his rest

from reds
through oranges
to yellows
many years
of orange-red
have passed
he has discovered
some permission
in his garden
to paint
the lights and colors
that come last





279

the morning
gives
one set of mists 
of shadows
high noon 
another fashion
toys the eye
evening reflections
add
are added
varieties
of visions
will not die

from reds
he has ascended
into yellows
with vision of a blindness
he builds light
until the higher calling
cooler
colors
the violets
are versions 
of delight

What is the sense of a dog?
A dog is always home.

THIS IS A DAY

this is a day the lord has made
filled with a holy faith and grace
into destruction we have strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face

we may well vanish without a trace
this is a day the lord has made
with a shadowed terror we must face
what land did we so swift invade

We've in what devil's thicket strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face
this is a day the lord has made
what demon chose we to embrace

with a shadowed terror we must face
such foolish victims, fools out-played
in burned out times in a desert place
this is a day that the lord has made

SANDSCAR

on wire wheels the robot buggy creeps along
upon a grainy bed of rocks pulverized
by blow on blow of little bits
once eager to be planets
settling now to be a trifle grain of sand
upon a smiling moon.

the tracks it leaves
are straight and slowly formed
by a control a hundred thousand leagues away

is anything there that moves
any sign of at all
that something happened once
that something came along
just now
or long ago

HAMLIN'S LINE

When Hamlin draws a line in thin air
his fingers trace a shape of strong allure
like nothing that has ever been before
we think we see what is not really there.

The shape becomes the life, the life of those
who tried to love him; loving him was all
they ever got to kjow of him..who knows
if he had more in him.  A pall
of vast unknowing--what they chose
to love was maybe real--or fictional.

He had no knack for drawing lines--his air
of acting like he knew--his sweet allure
let people think they knew him--loved him--for...
for what?  What they imagined, really, nothing there.Mom's empire of acquired knick-knacks had finally come to the state of being shared among the daughters: the wall displays of plates, the desk top statuettes, the finer pieces of furniture, were all easily apportioned one by one to the daughter who wanted each item more than the others did. When they had finished, compromises and trade-offs accomplished, there
remained the one last item, for me, the only son. They had all remained silent about the one piece they knew I would value above all others: the twig chair, the worn, almost useless creaky chair her father had made almost a century ago.

284
SHEEP                        

A day together, picnic without crowds.
We find a beach the others would reject
For you insist 
on water. Clouds 
reflect
the distant pinetrees, self-effaced in mist.
                        
The wash of short-lived suds 
		on hard-packed sand;
the great waves rolling, roaring, laugh and speak
                        lines we expect.
                        Here we might stand
                        a week
to watch where crumbled mountains 
		lie foam-flecked.
                        
White gull cries, water, rock, air, sand, and sun
on this stretch are no cans or bottles strewed
                        and here we sneak;
                        the shore where none
                        intrude
with reasons for the blush upon your cheek.
                        
You let me find your buttons, ties, and hooks
to let the sun have you--while I stay dressed
                        as you run nude
                        you have with looks
                        impressed
so I am only prudent not a prude.                     
  
285
                   
Beneath some trees, as if set by Manet,
we are a composition "tres superbe"
                        We two at rest
                        "Le déjeuner
                        sur l'herbe"
 (which still some dull establishments protest.)

 Leaf sounds from bushes, steady, rustling, brisk,
 do not add to the sense we are alone.
                        A little scared--
                        because of risk--
                        (our own)
 and wondering if what we did, we dared.
                        
 Just as you are we run, now brave. We spring
 both laughing as our timid smiles we flash
                        forward to known
                        and unknown things.
                        We dash--
 the raw earth colors blend with your skin tone.
                        
 At least this moment seems both fresh and new.
 We pick our careful way through nearby weeds,
                        thistles and burrs.
                        I carry you
                        (good deed)
  but not enough control for what occurs.




286

 Earth's surface rises here to rocks, sharp, sheer.
 Some of the weeds are spreading, some have died.
                        We have more need
                        to take care here
                        or hide.
 Watch out! I slip, you scrape your knee, it bleeds.
                        
 Against a steep rise, difficult rock face,
 some pain, much fear your sudden silence tells
                        Ways must be tried
                        from this hard place
                        or else.
 For all at once, life's not all cut and dried.

 The bleeding slows. I have you on my back.
  I study handholds, seeing lichens, granite blocks,
                        some ancient shells,
                        the green, blue, black
                        of rocks,
 with spells of balance, balancing of spells.
288

 Not certain, both our body weights combined
 of making headway here where rocks are steep
                        bruises and shocks
                        sharp pebbles grind
                        I creep.
 A new sound. A lone beast strayed from flocks.
                        
 A bleat, a movement, walking cloud of white:
 he knows the path. We are no longer stuck.
                        found by a sheep,
                        a welcome sight,
                        This buck
  becomes a friend we hope that we can keep.
                        
 He scrambles from us, showing us the way.
  Easy steps a passage I'd have missed.
                        A fast pace struck,
                        your clothes, new day,
                        The gist:
 we have some gods who care for us, or luck.

THE SWEEPER AT CHARTRES 

The tall statue, 
mournful but beautifully at peace 
on the main facade of Chartres
got very tired one day of standing for centuries
in one crowded niche among other saints
and slipped to the ground

standing without support from the church
was difficult -- he hadn't anticipated
difficulties so trivial -- 
he lay on the ground for a while
before crowds were to be milling about
wanting to look at him.

the sweeper came along cleaning up the debris
of all those crowds with his green broom
what to do with this fallen statue
so heavy but he got it into his cart
and off he went stumbling 
feeling his arms stretch

Before he got to the thing
he was to dump the load in
however he was himself completely stretched 
His heart gave out; he fell stone dead.
He lay, he was as long  as the statue.
Authorities had quite a time figuring out 
which statue to put back in the niche.

291
After global research, 
they selected the wrong one
The first statue is now stones in a brook
singing praises of the universe
the second is among the saints
mournful but beautifully at peace 
he is looking at an old green broom 
near a construction shed; he would like a chance
to clean the street one more time

MURAL

this letter is a mural
runs along the wall
across the window
right on the glass
write on

one long line
now and then
it runs off sidelines
sidebars
shaped  locutions
of nonsense 
and misguided sagacity

forgets itself 
and runs up 
to the ceiling
falls to the floor
trundles along
out the door
up on the wall again
out in the hallway
leading to the elevator

close the door
don't let it get out
into the lobby downstairs
nothing to stop it with
no way to clean it up

293


now down the street
correctible conclusions
on the curbs of humanity

Who now will overcome
this spread of the letter
that is a mural
will it discover the mountain

and then the valley

how did it get started
this inexhaustible supply
of ink and words
inside a small brush
to swish and slide
on all the surfaces
of the world












294



worse than rhyme vi

oh i tell you she was mad
un-made

RAISE

I have raised my hand
no reason
no one is asking for an answer
it is all figured out
no questions come along

my hand is embarassed
but muy arm needs to hold it high
not to  get called on
not to go to the bathroom
the position relieves the muddied
pools of his badness

it is my arm that is raised
my arm as strong as
the will power to ignore
what is going on


296


BLACK CURRANT		

When you first came with currants from the brush
"Casseesse!" you said (I didn't know the word,
knew it was French). I followed you. What stirred
in me came from your press,  you had to crush
the fruit in firm caress and keep the blush
of ripeness of that berry. You conjured
a flight in me with movement of a bird
that sang delights of juices dank and lush.
	
A private potion it is now, unknown
among the people here. New wine you made
for me, still calling it that foreign name.
We forage this rare fruit with baskets sewn
from swampland grass which crunches where we wade
to take "cassis" with taste we would not tame.

A game of Scrabble takes the afternoon;
That part of it I spend with you, or you
With me: between the bookcase -- finished soon -- And watching "As You Like It," channel two.
Such letters, where one drownes, it so enwords
Me. Where to play: the puzzle still remains.
Snowred?  A proper noun? I try ownerds--
That means those weirdos who would play with pain.
I'm taxing even your calm. You forebear,
So I try downers.  You say that's too sad.
Resowned you tell me takes a U.  Such care
To spell; like, "Have I onswered..." That's so bad, 
You say.  So Sownder? All these blunders;
Will they never cease, one wonders... Wonders!

299

T S  Eliot
       
He was so matter of fact telling the news about the universe. 
When that got old, the universe,
still young, had nothing much  
for anyone to tell about.
Later, when, like Einstein.
we came to understand him, 
the truths had changed. 
Still there is power
in what we thought he knew;
one head challenging
the galaxies 
to give up pictures of their skeletons.
I should have taken the bicycle tour
it couldn't have been harder and a lot cheaper
and faster

   HERITAGE REWRITTEN 

Grandma lost all patience over Grampa. 
    His nodding off at supper 
    His sipping wine 
    	cigars 
    	cigars with ashes 
    	always ashes. 
She takes the poems of his pages 
    	how the moon 
    	had broken off to stars 
    	(and others no one read 
    	had ever read) 
    And throws them in the fire. 
Oh, sweet and final vengeance 
    	she gives him ashes. 
While I with always ashes in my pen 
    I do these pages.

A tree pretends
to be symmetrical
The tree pretends
that between each root
each twig
a magic straw

makes it possible
to draw
from mushroom roots
and cold worm trails
the happy efflorescence
of an orange or a pear

DOTS

My life's a field of dots
like pictures in the News
ideas set in slots;
someone must choose
the ones to use
then set the matte
to print the lots.
That's that

BEFORE HIS BIRTH

how could she have known that in the days
before his birth the stars converged to grow
a brightness meant to let some shepherds know
what stars were doing: concentrating rays
as but symbolic for a larger phase
of new ideas knotting to let glow--historical significance--to throw
life's meaning backward with a craze
for taking god so bloody big in ways
that numbed the brain; that thwarted mental flow
--imagined god above and life below.
The separation crosses and betrays
the hope of once discovering the tie;
the one of grass, plain ground with clear blue sky

PRINT

print your name on the dotted line
your first name. No, your very first name:
your name before that, before the syllable
you knock around with day to day
your first name, not that,
keep trying. Maybe you will get it tomorrow.

Print where you were born
Not the city, this is not geography class.
No, not that. This is not anatomy class.
the place the universe made for you.
Keep trying, Ask around.
Maybe you will get it tomorrow.

Print your profession. 
Beyond what you get paid for
Designate your function.
What does the universe have going
that it would not have without you.
What is it you will have done
after you are not remembered anymore.

How is it you go on without this information?
Who you are, where you are, what you are.
Somehow this must be provided
for the space 
that you must break into 
print

HOPING TO KEEP UP AFTER SEVENTY

When the morning clouds arise
not as faithful as the sun
but regular enough
will I still have two good eyes
or at least one
so that getting off my duff
I won't stumble
hear friends mumble
as I grumble

When friends and birds begin to chatter
after silences of night
as the heavy darkness clears
not that what they say will matter
idle nattering of light
will I still have two good ears
or must I watch the spreading lips
with fear that gossips
lose their grip?

When the tiny leaves of spring
turn the browned-off earth to green
and there is talk
of adventues while we sing
of the beauty to be seen
will I still have legs to walk
or must I only in my mind
such lonely pleasure find
while left behind

308


When aromatic flowers
brighten landscapes with their color
will I have the heart to follow
or will I have lost such powers
Will I grow dull and duller
life gone hollow
or will my faculties extend
to the end
to have and be a friend

I SING MY HEART

I sing my heart out in a wilderness
like a victim of some violence
too horrible to tell.  My private fate
that will not let itself be known until
--on this calm afternoon of blind distress--
a final mistic ignorance descends
while those more competent than I await
to sing much louder their soft vesper hymn.
I listen for a shushing antinym.


TO SELL

Must sell the season's crop, it will not last
the day. Must push the creaking wagon past
who hungers for a word or two and so
the Merchant of Four Seasons calls out, "Buy
my oranges, my lemons, peaches.  Try
 these still lifes now, before they have to go,
before as day goes on the sun rides high.

If harvest food or music be what pays
he chants his lingo, he repeats his phrase
each seventh step.  (He always ends on eight,
like sergeants beating time into recruits).
Who will not buy a peach for twenty cents.




318

KICKING 
 
Kicking a can, inexpert but cocksure,
he clears the way his Rapid Flyer needs
to coast him down again his neighbor's hill.
Again, again, adventures clash and rattle
down from chariot to rocket, scars of battle
to a Band-Aide knee. 
               With thirst he needs some shade
where little sister sells her red Kool-Ade.

A few years later weapons far more real
more real as well the danger if he bleeds.
"Dear Mommy, may I go out now and kill?"
Not even someone kindly dialing nine
one one, just, "medic, can we help to heal
this one? He's worth the time? Have we a cure?"
"No, too far gone.  Just morphine will be fine."

IF

If he had died a cleaner death so those
who followed, who admired, yes, who believed,
even those who worshipped as they grieved, 
had left us all a finer way to close
off lives that we in clumsy faiths oppose,
we might learn to have more pity for bereaved
kinfolk, to care that gravestones can be heaved
away as of no weight.

THAT WATERFALL

That waterfall, its energy, such waste,
so profligate our earth is, so much time
to spin around, a top, a toy, so blue
and green, great clumps of grey 
		and white and years:
a hundred thousand for a cliff to break
off one small bit of rock; the canyon grows
by inches -- millimeters then -- refaced
with fresher elements.  God only knows
how long a planetoid may take
to form a half-way stable cliff that shears
away thin layers, how long to see it through,
change habit, heap up mountains, 
		do earthquakes,
add thought, become aware of jokes and fears,
format a word, within a mind, for rhyme.














321

ONE DAY

One day like another all go by
never a thought that some day he might die.
Might--what does that mean--might?
Of course he will, but it is worth a  fight,
in' it?  Say it is. Keep up the show.
Don't let grandchildren see, oh... 
do they already know
that sooner or later can mean soon not late.

Something ticking in there sets a date.
So, clocking along each minute seems to mock
what should go on, and on. Tick, tock.

But each day matters, makes a difference
when hands go up, eyes bright, 
              exchange of sense.
Somehow communication still takes place,
light in the voice.  Someone remember the face.











322

THE BLAZE

The blaze reminded no one of bonfire,
bon is French for good, this is not good;
meant to destroy, sent to bring fear, entire
blocks of cities burn, not only wood,
the very paint, the plastic forms melt, spark
more flames.  How much pain in the awful dark
of panicked night can a raging fire cause?
  
What do nerves do? Draw back like kitten claws,
go unconscious, faint away?

COBWEB

A cobweb heavy with the dust 
                                     it filters from the air
disgraceful object, yet nobody sweeps it down,
others like it hide sharp corners of the room.

Under one such cobweb-blanket on the woodbox
beside the seperator, something there?  We lift the web, surprised  to find a souvenir, a statue we had given him one birthday. Had he kept it here to be reminded in the morning while he took the cream for income from the milk, so as he worked the handle round and round his eyes could steady on this prize, or had he placed it here and then forgot that it was here, or if he saw failed to understand, did not remember anything of that story he had told us many times 
		in our believing years.

GREY WOLF

Does the grey wolf state his purpose in his howl
for his companion: "Here we follow.
Something has gone by here, in the night,
something live and full of substance has gone by.
Together we may find it, make it ours."  


Does the grey wolf know 
that one thing, then another
makes a sequence, takes him to an end
that he can plot and carry out,  repeat.















325

GONE 

I do not want them to be gone,
the friends I've had and lost.
Some say that they have traveled on
or that there is a bar they crossed.
I say come back we are not done,
I want to walk where they walk, not hostile
to the system, I simply do not want
a closure definite forever, wall
without a window or more calls
of any kind, at any cost
sealed beneath fake placid lawn,
it is so politely mocking, they are gone.

RIGHT OR WRONG

"AT LEAST FOURTEEN OF THE NAMES... WERE NAMES OF LIVING MEN"
                     New Yorker, Nov.30, 1992, p.41

A special trip to Washington.  A chill
goes through him as he reads the wall
of names.  Did they really kill
him, really?  for he has read
his own name among the honored dead.
A clerical mistake?  But to erase
those errors, far too high a cost
once that polished granite was embossed,
once the hero did not die, that is all,
officially.  No one will make redress.

So, do we honor living soldiers less?
or count them, because it might
have gone that way.  He, living still,
may wonder, does he, after all, belong
(for goodness sakes, he asks, 
		questions, Is it right?)
Somehow he cannot let it go, it may be wrong
that he go on, have a job, a family, a wife
or any dutied loves that make a life.

THE GOLDEN GATE

Where does it take us
if we go
suspended between 'of course' of course
and 'maybe, maybe not.'


STOCKHOLM

The sea reflects 
reality: the sky reflected --
-- itself a blue. The very air so blue
that floating clouds cannot reduce
the calm intensity
opposing lands connect connects.













330


WALK

We started out not thinking we would walk
so far, but step led on to step. A pair
of rabbits -- are they not single, as one finds
them normally -- each small white tip
of tail went under bushes disappeared
so neatly we weren't sure what we had seen.

That got us started looking, what was seen?
So many surprising little things, 
		a walk can bring you,
like new pavement cracks appeared
since yesterday, dandelions, a pesky pair
of thistles. Careful, dear, in taking off their tip.
A busy line of ants -- one finds
ants everywhere. One even finds
them deeper under ground. I've seen
them four feet down, a nest. The tip
is all you see.  Now you walk
by where some small mounds built as a pair
of carefully arranged sand, has appeared.

Now that reminds me what the detective finds;
stockings and a pair
of undies, what else have we seen?
More than I want to talk about. A walk
is not the time, we see the tip,


331

a little proof of so much underneath. A tip
does not reveal much. It's appeared 
you may be ready. Not this walk. This walk
is not about what someone finds,
is not about what someone has seen,
is not about some stockings or a pair
of undies. We were a pair,
what are we now?  I feel the tip
of some shipwrecking iceberg, large, unseen
until too late, then appeared
with wreckage ... all he finds
goes much farther than I meant this walk
to go: step by step, a pair.  What appeared 
no more than a tip, what if one finds
what cannot be seen?
Walk.















332

THE HOUSE

The house I want to go to was torn down.
Just dumped you might say into its own pit
or cellar, not a decent basement quite.
A place to keep potatoes,  out of town
far enough that friends were scarce.  
		One good friend
or two is all one needs, we tend
to gather far too many. Isn't it
a shame , such burden-building ...slight
acquaintances, now that's another matter;
good people all around, that is living right.

But friends, a person who can know about
what scared you when you were a little kid
just five, or so, before you learned to read
so you were victim to all sorts of scares: what did
the midnight ghost do, if he caught you? Shout
mean words at you.  Cause everything to end?
Gang up and depants you in the park?
Leave you in a cellar, cold and dark.









333


A friend, someone predictable enough
that if you need her, or him, say at noon
( it is so easy to be helpful after six,
at noon, is much more difficult). It's tough,
he says. Why sure, now, opportune,
it isn't."  Did you want to fix
your scooter,  or your bike?
what would you like?

A friend goes on beyond a simple task,
ready to try to help; no need to ask.



















334

DOOR

My front door opens to a load of speed,
of chases, deals, last-minute runs to get supplies
the sun sends baking pushing heat
to hasten what occurs.

My back door opens to a yard
of blooming weeds,
a sneaking rabbit with its bunny eyes
nibbles cautiously, but nibbles, eats
what I think of as mine: she knows it's hers


















335

NAME

Did you call my name?
I thought I heard you call my name.

No, I didn't call your name.

I distinctly heard your voice call my name

What else did you hear?

Nothing else, just that and just once.

Strange.  Did you see me, too?

No, just heard your voice.

Where did you think I was?

In the next room.

I was. If you see me and I am not there, 
that will be serious.

Hearing is not serious?

Do you think it is?

No, I can just forget it.

Shall I mark it in the calendar?
336
If you want to.

We don't want you to go on hearing
what is not spoken.  That's hallucination.

What a dreadful word.

Isn't that right?  Hallucination.

What does it mean, where does it come from?

It means you think you hear me call but I haven't.  Have you heard others?

No, just that.

What if you were to hear a car horn?

That's not so bad, so long as I don't drive into the ditch to get out of the way.
 
Or a scream?

And I run to help someone who isn't there.

What are some words--let's make a list of words you don't want to hear.

"Come here" would interrupt what I am doing.



337

Were you doing anything just now when I called your name? I mean when you thought I called your name?  

I wonder, what it is-- the difference between memory and imagination, and in between hallucination.

What are you talking about?

Can I imagine a sound I've never heard?

If it's a word, yes.

Putting together sounds in ways I haven't heard?

I'm lost.

Can I imagine a trumpet if I've never heard a trumpet?

Not exactly.

Can I imagine a voice singing, a voice I've never heard?

A song yes, the words,  but not a new sound.

How does one create a new tune?

338

What a weird thought

Or a painting, that is not a memory.

Oh, you just splash it around and decide what to keep.

Suppose I imagine a painting of something I have never seen?

Can you do that?

Some people can.

No, I think they have paintbrush accidents, happy ones,  they like what happens.

Do people sometimes talk that way?

That's crazy.

So, it scares me. What if I am going crazy?  How do I know if I am crazy or not?

What difference does it make?

Will anyone understand me?

I'm here.



339
What if I talk about things 
or people that aren't there?

Not here, you mean.

What if I imagine a fifth primary color.

There are three.

No, there are four.

Oh, dear, would you like a bowl 
of that soup I made?

You made soup?

You had some, just had some for lunch.

I don't remember.

CLOSING

The house is closing, 
no more show
take down fold up the curtain
wrap the lenses
take apart the dimmer,
other machinery
and paraphernalia
put away the systems
bit by bit

the uncountable chairs
cushions and all
have already gone
to other uses
in other houses

tell the children
to remember happy times

the pauses waiting for response
the lost lines with made up
subsitute lines never spoken again
and no one knew the difference
the grandchildren need not know
cannot know the details
of the putting on
the pain of make-up
the ache of muscles wearing out

341

but let them know
make sure they know the stories
and for a few
help them to hear
the march of words
across a line.

  DAIREN

Keats looked at a Grecian urn
and thought about the figures on it
--human figures doing a lovely thing--
Michelangelo has the same sort of moment
painted on a ceiling 
only it is man and God
doing a lovely thing--
both have a moment of 
portent turned into everlastingness--

so if I paint even a thought or a wisp
of color on a page

I will be thinking
of all other paintings
putting my painting
in a line of succession
that the Cloudy Curator
will catalog
because that is his job

and for a moment
find Himself
grateful 
or not

COBWEB

A cobweb heavy with the dust it filters from the air
disgraceful object, yet nobody sweeps it down,
others like it hide sharp corners of the room.

Under one such cobweb-blanket on the woodbox
beside the separater, something there?  We lift the web, surprised  to find a souvenir, a statue we had given him one birthday, had he kept it here to be reminded in the morning while he took the cream for income from the milk, so as he worked the handle round and round his eyes could steady on this prize or had he placed it here and then forgot that it was here, or if he saw failed to understand, did not remember anything of that story he had told us us many times in our believing years.

CHRISTIAN
(Written on behalf of a parent of one of my students)
       robert temple
The only family I have
is my first-born son, Christian.
Thirteen now and he and I
have been together four years.
His mother lives 
a thousand miles from here
along with our two other sons
ten and eight.
If Christian will talk to me
like he used to
it's worth it all
my childhood of bouncing around
from one place to another
worth it if he will talk to me

One person can be so much to you
even your own kid
if it's the only family you have
When they stole our Atari ST
he just shut up
I hardly see him now except meals
He opens his mouth to eat





356
Maybe he knows I set up the thefts
to collect both ends,
steal the piece then have it stolen.

He's a smart kid.
He must have figured out
all the thefts we've had by now.
His mother will get him... 
I'll never get him back
two years from now
when I get out.

Try talking to a thirteen-year-old 
about two years.
Everybody thinks a hole of two years
out of my  life
will leave me better.

KEY

Found a round key 
beside a four-leaf clover
it will open any car trunk
a hundred car trunks

car tools,  bloody clothing,
rotting bags of groceries,
fresh groceries, a dummy,
a corpse, old tires, 
water-stained books, emptiness,
holes you see the road through,
boxes full of empty boxes,

I am still looking 
for a square key
to turn a spark
lemme burn outa here
find something I want

at the front door:

ORANGE-EYED DRAGON
	robert temple

A girl was coming along
from her house
to the store nearby.
She met a dragon
wreathed in heavy dark smoke.
A small flame sputtered out each ear,
loose scales were falling from its neck.

"What may I get for you?"

The dragon didn't answer.,
but looked tearfully at the human.
The dragon rolled her eyes upward,
the yellow of long-lizard illness
showing around the orange
center of her eyes.

The young female human
decided not to go to the store
but to the sorceress's castle down the street.

	(We never hear about this castle
	because no one wants to have to say
	sorceress's.)



360

She walked up to the two doors,
one very large door
for very important people
and one small door for children.
She knocked at the small door.

An instant whining sound came 
from the large door 
like a complicated mechanical device
that takes a long time to get ready.

At last the large door opened.
"Please help..."
"Again?" said a red-faced woman
in a ragged dress
with wooden spoons in her pockets
and kettles on her elbows,
"Please come in and take care of the castle.
I'll be back unless the dragon 
flies me over the mountain.
Read the books.
Feed the children."

The girl went in and waited.
After having read many books 
on how to be a sorceress
and having made thousands of banquets
in the great kitchen
and thousands of breakfasts
in the lesser kitchen


361

and thousands of picnics
in the garden room
she noticed that the children
did not go off to the village classes 
no matter how often
she read to them
no matter how often
they were allowed 
to nibble in the herb garden
or dress in old clothes
to clamber through the hedge maze.
No matter how often 
they had afternoon tea with biscuits
with butter and honey
or morning exercises in the willow
and tansey goat stream
or wading in the lily and frog pond
no matter how often they were allowed
to take the clocks apart
to ride up and down on the hay lift
they did not go to school.

She noticed an orange-eyed dragon
was drooping its head
in the yardberries.

Just at that moment,
someone knocked at the door.

INVITATION FROM A FRIEND 
 Would you know me? Then come walking, hold my elbow, watch my eyes, what I look at, maybe see. Understand now, this is tricky, would you riddle with a robin? My own flights are far more sudden. When you know where I will go next, why the pond to me will matter, why the stars will wake me coldly, how the grass will bed me kindly, how the trees will hold me straighter, when the rain will clean my body needing washing smile to footstep, then we have begun a knowing for a woodland walk together.

 HUNTER'S STORY

We sat around the fire, we'd hunter grouse.
Skid started talk about a bear but Stub
told him to knock it off, he said to Skid,
Why you don't know  a thing about a bear,
ain't true at all the stories about bear,
real master of these northern woods is wolf.

We talked about another guy we'd known,
had been with us a little off and on,
had got himself in trouble and they tried
him, stuck a needle in him so he died.
Why, that's no way to go, said Judd. Which way
is better? Woods can hold a lot of silence.

Now Stub gets going on this audience.
If I done something real real bad, got caught,
got to the point that they ask me which way
I want to go, well, I'd say wolf.  To die
by wolf, an honor if you have to go.

I wouldn't want it; love too much the plain
and simple life.  What harm it does the wolf--
you think about the other critter, too--
is it a crime for him.  But from that list
of choices: shooting squad, or guillotine,
injection, 'lectric chair, ice floe, 
		I choose the wolf.  



364
Quick slash, give him your throat; he knows
the what-for, what to do.  That's better'n dog...
Dogs don't know how to kill, go for the groin,
hamstring.  Bear ain't no killer, hug a guy
to death real slow from sheer stupidity.
A lion even he don't do it right,
he bites down on your face to smother you.
Constrictor snake don't know enough about
what it is doing to you, don't know you.

A wolf will square off,  look you in the eye,
take measure, go in, make it to your throat.
a kind of honor in it. Skid don't like
one word of that at all, says something 'bout
they wouldn't give you any choice, it come
to that.  Stub says to Skid: why, you don't know
'bout woods at all. You should have gone along
with Freddie into town.  Here's how it goes,
if 't has to be.  Sight off the shoreline here;
(This upper lake's a hundred mile of shore,
straight line, and it ain't north and it ain't west.
It makes its own direction, its own world.)

You take a rightline off it, go straight way
into the wild far back 's a day will get
you. First you pass the waterfall--there ain't
no river here but got a fall--they go
to perpendicular two ways at once--
then level swampland, 
	moss and trash tree growth,
a forest, trees not good enough to take
for boards, just popple, tamarack, then brush.
365


Day's end you hunker down against a wall
of toppled tree, the one that took its roots
up with it as it fell, cave for the night
--man ain't done much inventing: this world gives
it first.  You howl a wolf up now and sit.

Stub howls, we hear the forest waiting.
Skid thinks: a sleazy story with an end
to make you jump, and be a fool. He snorts.
This better be a European wolf...
Our native wolves--yes, even timber wolves--
don't kill... none ever has.  So there's your tale.

Stub, he's so far gone in his story, he 
don't care: so bring me one right off the Steppes
that's killed before.  This wolf is watching you
as morning shows the smallest bit of light.

He's watched by starlight, now you get to see...
don't know he's there at all till he comes out
looks hard into your eye then circles you,
gets closer, pretty soon he's close enough--
that's his decision--turns and takes you down.

Slash to the throat, he gets the blood out quick.
The blood flows from the brain so you don't know...
for this is his big moment, it's not yours.

366


So if I had to pick the way to go:
electric chair or drowning, poison cup,
injection, I'd say for that crumb of life
the little bit between man and the world,
when you have got that far, the end, choose wolf.




CAPRICE

I just found out
I am a goat
the evidence 
is overwhelming
I have horns
I have a beard
I need glasses
I say baa a lot
I am sure-footed
I will eat anything
the lower half of me
is raunchy
and then
the smell




367

WINTER

Because it snowed
in city park
and street--hills glowed
through fingered bark
with grays on white--
our window showed
the longest night 
not really dark.

When you were down
strength all but gone
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets packed to stone
we skated on



368
HORSES
  

We took the horses with us for the grass
so they could pasture there and roll
on level grassy ground. They like to rub
a working back against a smoother field--
all stones and rubble where we are--
no place to lay a body on the earth
play with this rolfing planet for a while.

 Imagine horses rolling fast downhill
 their legs tucked up, their necks out-stretched,
 a spin of such unpardonable joy.
 
 The horse would never stand to walk again.

As much as man has problems with his build,
A horse has more and even without sport
Can get a twisted gut that kills.
                                             You have
to slide your hand up into him and slow
move up and straighten as you go, your hand
salvation if you do it right, except
the sick and frightened animal won't know
what you are up to and may give a kick
to send you for a sprawl.  That twisted gut
is common, not a rare form for a death




369
A head-on run downwind is sport enough.
a horse can go short distances at speed
that flies your hair, can spray his voice
across a prairie, let it know someone
is coming, something's up.  
                           For friendship's sake--
I didn't let that notion in too soon--
we took the horses with us for the grass.


Safety Cap
	
The cap so hard to open that the pill
rolled out along the floor, a tattle sound
that said too much, he turned around;
'What is this clatter, are you really ill?'
	
She held her stomach, it was only fear
that hurt, but hurt more than she cared to stand.
'You are not ill, the doctor said the pain
 was nothing but imagination;  here
give me that bottle, put it in my hand.'
She let him take it...  
	                             let 
	                                the dishes 
	                                             drain.
	
Then she saw on the counter one more pill,
she must have lost it there.  Without a sound
she swallowed it. He did not look around.
The pain was dulled, perhaps she was not ill.

GREEN PARK
     


Children are a river flowing out of night
into a park to worship fountains. Soon
they leave life's wishing hours
self-shaping, seven-skilled:
a wave
Through life from life, moving as form does.
The grave
and aging ocean, through half-waking shocks
must ask: is this the soul I had...
Or was?
   
Butchers of beauty on diets of delight
they play upon green banks, their parents strewn
with sandwiches and grass. They clamor noon,
fast-moving and strong-willed, 
a raft
is broken on their rocks.
They laugh
while killing flowers
which die for them
fulfilled.

AN EXERCISE IN PREPOSITIONS


They built a bridge to drive
  across the river
They pulled a hundred fishes
  from the river
Those who hoped to learn
  the river
  tried
Those who claimed to save
  the river
  lied

They dumped the city garbage
  in the river
They cooled the stores and buildings
  with the river
Two laughing kids who drank 
  the river
  died
The lonely ones who loved
  the river
  cried

Because we are not part
of the million scrambled children
hutted uphill
from the January river

Because we are not part
of the business built bonfest
who ride out to them
between afternoon closing
and family dinner
to down a few
with bullets well-placed for kindness

We thank you
merciful giver of every good 

Because we are not half-dying
from newly discovered diseases
caught when we believed
that love is free

Because we have no need
to care for them 
or have to bury them
as we talk about a testimonial

Most of all because
OTR means one touch record
and never in all our lives

to merge with ours can it
ever come to mean

I never open my chest
without first looking around

Almost a perfect zero

then I shout
I am open

I shout 
and the glittering flakes
of friendship fall
i shout them up to my waist
my neck
I go on shouting
deeper than anyone's chance

BUDAPEST JULY 1984

Half a circle round the bus-tour guide
Inside his own half circle, where the great men
enstone his country's history in pride,
some children scramble on and off again
away from earth a little, climb, leap. land
The guide seems somewhat bothered by it all
He gestures with his head, hand held in hand
the hidden fingers where... the hand so small?

He praises these great men, a cut-off tale
great empire shrunk to dominated form,
the silicon age the children scale
our guide oh no, forgetting , raises his arm
forgotten hand, or hand he can not find
to point to one more statue of a king;
not gesture with, No tourist mind 
380


provides such closure.  Not some little thing
a metal form, carved wood, to fit a glove
		to show concern, 
one child his wrist bent in play...
not what this government was thinkng of...
a child's sleeved arm points handless our guide's way.

A PAST I DREAMED WAS MINE

My finger nails have stopped growing.
A serious thing when you are fifteen.
Even dead people grow fingernails,
a detail pepople forget whan they draw ghosts.
I know my fingernails arenot growing
because I broke one off short two weeks ago
		it's still short.
I made a chart to mark when I cut my nails,
that was ten days ago. I haven't marked it yet.
Maybe they rest a while, so there's hope.
I don't believe that.
Whatever awful thing has happened to me
I am stuck with it.
My fingernails have stopped growing.

I eat,
I still shave once a week.
I do all the other bodily functions.
I still need a lot of sex and don't get any.
I am not growing fingernails.
I will wait a week more maybe two
then I will have to get help.
Somehow.
I won't go through my parents,
forget them.
My dad, what a yucky word,
so much like dead.
My Dead sends my Mom money,
the court forces him to.

382
My mom still thinks she can ground me
Me.
I am fifteen.  She sends me to my room:
does she come by later to check
if I have crawled out the window,
does she care who is making all the noise
when I rattle around in the garage
for fifteen minutes to dig out my bike,
does she look up when I ride past 
the front of the house.
She sits there being pretty for her boyfriend.
I bike off.

I take the old country road
around the sewerage
and up to Blandin Hill.
It is gettng dark, but that does not matter
I get every curve and rise
memorized in my body

The hill is a good place to sit,
The cemetery is nearby
so the hill  is lovely
so I think about ghosts.
I wonder if my dad will want go be brought back
to this town when he dies, 
if he dies while i am still young.
I could brush dirt off his gravestone.
I am walking now along the back edge
of the cemetery alone,
I should see ghosts.

383

I wish I was the right kind of person,
not so rotten inside.

My dad's dad is here,
will dad want to be buried here?
I walk over to the grave.
I don't need light to do this,
just stars.
The white pine near the grave
is a huge shape in the sky.
I feel the stone.
How long is the grave?
I stretch out,
I am still short.
The grass is covered with dew
The ghost of my grampa should be here.
I slam my fist into the ground.
Mom doesn't care where I am.
I have to go to the bathroom.
My fingernail hurts.
My shirt is soaked.
I should go on the grave.
Why do I think like that?

I walk back up the hill.
The dark is heavier than usual,
Some clouds have crept over. 
I can't find the bike.
Trash it.  Who wanted to go home.
I go near some bushes.
I can hardly find Grampa's tree again.
384
I am not sure it is Grampa's grave I am on.
The grass is even wetter now.
The clouds are letting go a soft mist,
Water is running on my skin
inside my shirt.
I am too much of a ding-dong 
to  have worn a jacket.

The noise of a car
has me scrambling into bushes.
Light is scattered all over from the junk heap.
Some guys with some chicks.
I see light on my bike.
I sneak around and get it.
The road is slicked over by the rain
but I get home.

Mom and her boyfriend
are still taking up a lot of light and space.
I crawl through my window.
I get out of my clothes,
I let the sheets soak the wet off me;
I shiver as I get warm.

I remember watching a horse shiver once,
his whole body working this way and that
inside his skin.

My dad should see how I am shivering.
I have never felt so much inside my own skin.
The sheet is rippling
It is stopping,  I am warm.
385

I try to keep it going but it doesn't work
I lie quiet,
like on a grave,
my dad's grave;
his ghost is asking me about shivering.

Next week I'll rip down the chart.
By then I'll just have to be able
to cut my fingernails.


DRY

The desert plant droops,
each cell dreams of water.

The pendulum stops;
I have been swinging with it.

TOAST TO THE WINEMAKER

"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"
lifting his arm as usual, he said;
for many reason, one; to taste the wine.

As usual we answered, timid line,
that hand by which we had in turn been fed
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"

We gathered as we had so many times
with honor to  his table richly spread
for many reasons, one; to taste the wine.

Consumed by his ineriordsign
we knew, he knew this was the last heled
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"

We loved it all, we had no favorite kind:
as we loved him so bowed to his grey headfor many reasons, one; to taste the wine.

Now he is gone (full years, so never mind)
Yet, say, say, say again, not "he is dead"
"To grapes, to rain, rich earth, and full sunshine"
for many reasons, one; to taste the wine.

CRUCIFORM

So many were with vague or sure intent
discovering America, those wise
lost priests, and Portuguese in fishing guise,
Vikings...but not until Columbus sent
back Spanish Isabel word where he went
did Europe open its astonished eyes.
So end of life from flood or plague was prize
man lived with, but the Bomb new terror meant:

This world is ours, ours to destroy, our loss.
So each one must be savior: this leaves
no choice at all, must drag a bark-rough cross
to die abandoned pegged between two thieves;
in that last surge of life, remember moss
for water's taste with each stab he receives.

WHAT IF

When I was young I had great cause to wonder 
at all the views that traveled through my mind,
all this world with pieces of another
which has more marvels, dealing less with time
(time in the sense of passages exact
inside a world of animal and plant).

While living we don't know
                         which works we plant,
not for ourselves so not for one another.
The price which careless messages exact,
small pain ignored, give also cause for wonder
that we do so few damages in time
with all the loves and care we fail to mind.

The earthling with his hand-eye working mind
rests eagerly with numbers seen exact
such as the measured money, weight and time,
length, forcefulness which easily implant
a system leaving little cause for wonder;
one set as meaningful as any other.

With much of this world little of another
together we give too much thought to time
which leaves us not enough concern to wonder
at what is a truer nature of the mind
accustomed to environments of plan
and animal, each in a space exact.


390
What if the world unmeasured, inexact,
let plant like animal, like humans wonder?
What would we have to say to such a plant?
What if one animal and then another
should need a close attention from our mind
enrooted in full sun scaled in slow time.


What if we learned to live outside of time,
communicating slowly with each plant
or reached beyond our world to timeless mind
into some realm outside this scope exact;
some universal consciousness or other,
some flow of strong awarenesses or wonder.

In my young time I had full cause to wonder.
With nothing too exact within my mind
I let one world plant promise for another.

BIKING DAY

One baking day
on  county roads
when bikng was admenture,
we made it to the tower
on the mountain;
walking mostly,
pushing those strong bikes
with new departure coaster brakes
up that painful road
to the lookout tower,

390
the road mocked now
by cable rides and ski runs
for people nobody knows
to use the mountain
which has for them
the proper conformation:
See Dick Ski

That's how it's gone 
for most of us,
conformation
is the use of us
of most of us,




SONGBIRD

The songbird in the tree
would have us all believe

Sometimes I don't even like the mountain;

to any passing cloud.

MEXICO

the twelfth of January
Nineteen eighty-one

My dear,

Just received your letter
with the news
that you will spend two weeks
in Mexico.
I'll want to see your colored slides
when they are done;
you get so much of life
within each frame --
artist that you are.
You'll like it there

392
and see no beggars
except a village mother now and then
with one child wrapped within a shawl.
Here's hoping that you don't get sick
or robbed;
and Oh, my dear,
be careful with your camera in Mexico.

While I was there 
a two-year-old
escaped from her mother's shawl.
Charming toddler,
trusting among strangers.

I stopped to time the light,
to frame the scene;
lucky, I thought, to be a witness.
The mother swept up the child,
angry that a photograph
would lift some of the spirit
to be printed on a paper,
leaving the beloved one diminished.

So she believed.

As that Dutch painter
went to France
and gave his mind
in bits
to canvases
So he believed.

393
Well, as for that,
how much of life
will be consumed
of anyone
who tries to grasp
the golden point of view

Oh, how I ramble on.
My dear,

Be careful
with your camera 
in Mexico.


PHOTOGRAPHER

I do my scenes 
in black and white
not for simplcity
but for control.
The whole scene
must be mine
before it goes,
a gift
to anyone
who sees.

BIG IDEA

Your hand just now 
that rested on my arm
brought me images of love
or is that word too big

a more specific word is trust,
for you can rest your hand on me
any time you want to.
Still a closer word
is touch,
but what filled my head
importantly
was hand-on-arm
which soon gave way to still
another word:
hand.

NINETEEN SIXTY-EIGHT

The comfort of the kids
who took to streets,
brave hearts on tattered sleeves,
for bringing Prufrock
from obtuse to obvious, grieves
these added years;
their green words failing
after a rainless season
in this mid-summer orchard
with October leaves.
  Foolish were they                   396
in the cruel but flowered 
April of their year.
neglecting the unnamed orphan
who longed for life,
only to call her back now
bedded but not embraced
to be a barefoot wife
holding in compact purposes
a homemade pruning knife.

So must the young years grieve,
not so much for the tattered
of heart, not for the undreamed child,
as for her -- call her Winged Victory,
a dream of ancient heroines
where now and then she smiled;
not now beautiful,
see her the waif-wife
barren and wasted
as if once more exiled.

Tenderness new
not a recradled couple
with lovesong of the mime,
for no half measured serenades
endear or charm,
a stronger hold belongs
in this harsh time:
enfold both fear and faith
as from opposing prime
she young to you yields
in your now newly ageless arms.
397

DECIDING

Into my father's woodland I must go
where something waits, old, new, and 			heiroglyphed.
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

Perhaps the way be smooth the movement flow
or I may stumble in obstructing drift:
into my father's woodland I must go.

What good or bad result I do not know,
the message comes as neither choice not gift,
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

If progress falter so the way be slow
or if the paths be marked, the journey swift,
into my father's woodland I must go.

Ambition lets me proudly hope to grow
that others too may find my words a lift.
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

The  wisdom of such choice, 
  		long years may show
Where black and white by turns 
 		through branches sift.
Into my father's woodland I must go;
I must read blown dust on crusted snow.

this stage,

clambered down

quarreling on one event
absurd
unknowable,
chasing
after a fashion
debating
to abstract
what might be
the first
yes

word;
too late

it spent.

The blistering paint

Little tongues
are flicking.
I dare not open any doors.

Through the frame
on my window
the Flowers
watch
eye to my eye;
the Niobe
counting hours
of my garden,
no longer -- 
my Danish maiden -- 
cries

as flames

Without the strength to turn all with a just
To fnish this one breath and then one more

If that blunt shovel

I hadn't thought
his head
would be so soft;

the red life
running out of him
out of him
in all ways
going deeper deeper.

All the questions,
all the bother.
Well, let me ask a question:

use what has been harvested from years,
hold them, let them pay all back tomorrow
once the cloud of cold confusion clears.

somewhere further 
beyond perceived dimensions
a wholeness takes in all this piling and shoving
with a surface calm

COLUMBUS

The gods, we thought, are pleased, 
		for a majestic beast
that towered on the sea 
		was coming from the east
to visit us.  We saw a worm upon its skin--
no, those were crawling men 
		who somehow lived within.

They had no birth or death--no woman came along,
but they took ours.  
	They did not know that it is wrong
to take our women; take our goods, 
		to take and thieve...
such alien behavior.  
                                   They could not achieve
plain fatherhood alone but on our common beach
each took a turn upon each maid; 
		then went to reach
For yellow metal things of ours we did not use
except to fasten feathers.

                                We could afford to lose
this stuff, we learned to let them have it; 
		brought with smiles
to them what water-rounded stones we had...  		small piles
grew on their decks.  

411
	     We did not let them see the plumes
within our forest cache; 
		the sacred tree-made rooms
of truly valued stock.
                                    At last one day they left.
They had not learned of the most horrid, 
		dreaded theft:
the sacred feathers.  
              
                        What they did take, had not much
to do with life; but left with us a stronger touch
of death.  They could undo us, cut us all apart
with magic sticks that they could stab into a heart
or slice off arms, 
	           or point a hand-sized thunder blast
straight into us with angry slashing teeth.
                                                      The last
we saw of them, they floated off.  
			A sickness in our men
and women stayed behind.  
		To make them whole again
we gathered in 
	     our Clearing-Of-All-Wrongs around
the dead and dying with our drums and masks.
                                                 We found
that using what our wisest shaman knew 
			-- till dawn
we tried --  that all the cures went bad:  
		our gods were gone.

HAIKU 68

A pure white painting,
what can it mean?  All the art
is in the asking.

FOLLOWING FIRE

After the fires, the tourists came
Hoping the camps would be the same
But the trees were gone.  The bear
And deer moved to higher ground. Everywhere
Were the scars of flame.

We'd lost--we thought--what has been ours--
The great pine groves, the cedar towers
where a million people came each year--
Wiped out--whole mountainsides burned clear.
Then came the flowers.


ANAGRAMIST'S ANAGRAM

A rag man anagram.

COLD SEASON
      
Drifts of winter cover roof and window
wolves surround to choir moonlit glory
human in their hunger and their hunt;
huddled where we are, inside dark snow rooms
frightened; we are their game; they are not ours

Then summer, dark and burden melt 
to tasks we fall to; we are ever healthy to that
with the sun building harvest
from our working and our dirt.

In joy we turn to waste all we have won
except at night the grey beasts watch
to howl us winter comes again.

FIRST 
     
    created woman 
    saying 
    take this best of human 
    playing 
    for the chance 
    that knowing 
    of the choice 
    of right and wrong 
    become a place 
    for sowing 
     
    gave her voice 
    she gave back song

   BE A POET 
     
Who put it into him  to be a poet, 
someone stuck in a dime that he's so wordy? 
Must he jabber, must he drone, that hurdy-gurdy. 
Who put it into him to be a poet? 
     
    Just say it once that's all it needs. 
    He's not a novice telling beads. 
    Who  put it into him to be a poet? 
     
Why does he want to write it down? 
He'll never really get to town. 
Who put it into him to be a poet? 
     
    All those singers, actors, dancers, 
    they don't think they have the answers. 
Who put it into him to be a poet?

ROCKS

Rocks, skyward thrown, fall back 
as if by cruel keepers hurled.
Body and soul with changing weights
try to escape this world.

SNOW  

Snow the great eraser
covers all my tracks.
Old deeds are hidden but in snow
new deeds are clear as facts.

STARS

Why are the stars so far away?
the child asks in her faith.
It's all that distracting noise they make
by laughing, this year's old one saith

 MOUNTAINS 

Mountains are drawn on maps,
roses never are.
Someone thinks the peak is firm
that flowers outstay by far.



416

 EARTH  

Earth erupts with boiling rock,
far moons volcanoes spout;
"All energy is from the sun,"
professors have no doubt.

CYCLONES
 
Two hundred cyclones at one time 
frolic across some land or sea,
whirling with thunder, lightning,
winds, that arouse the dare in me.


SONGSPIREDVINE  2


The songs they'd hear
with boding-words
to make the ear
list heavenwards
acknowledging
the beauty of
the solacing
of work of love
with words
they'd know to hear



417

I him salute
whose roughened hand
and whose face mute
the wind withstand
the blushing cheek
yet weatherworn
the mute
the wind-red hand
( I have no plans
to build a spire
that's not this man's
task or desire )
No spire I  build
that is not done
my hope is stilled
(approach the sun?)
no plans]
and no desire.

Or if the vine
that I do plant
be in design
so elegant
that painters gaze
guitarists strum
and critics praise
the vine
that I do plant



418

then I shall say
it simply grew
I'd no mind pay
I little knew
the vine alone
did take the  shape
at beauty grown
those travelers gape
I say
I little knew


How much I'd like
to be just that
some happy strike
all fortunate
so natural
a shape to find
a form to call
but not to mind
just that
is what I'd like

RALPH
We never thought of Ralph as someone dumb.
He couldn't read but hadn't really tried.
He didn't seem to care at all, though some
said he had sat in Johnson's class and cried.

When we played ball, 
		Ralph played a far left field.
He couldn't catch a thing, but he would chase
And closer in he'd not keep his eyes peeled,
So he might stop a fast ball with his face.

He'd stand and dream and in the  tightest game
be watching butterflies down in the mud,
stand right on baseline, if a runner came
be looking at a pussywillow bud.

As we grew up and left our homes to go
to school, to work, to bum, we one by one
came proudly back to visit, and to show,
show off our wives, our kids, and all we'd done.

Ralph would be there still watching butterflies
chase dandelion seeds across the field.
We'd yell to him, "Hi Ralph." He'd hear our cries
and turn and raise his hand as if to shield

his eyes from slanting rays although clouds low might make the day quite dark.  
		He'd turn once more
and even when we got up close not know
exactly who it was he'd seen before.
420
If he put out a hand to touch a cheek
the wondering child of course would turn to run.
How had it become thus, old men would speak
his name, kids run?  When had this way begun?

I said, "Hi, Ralph." He looked into my eyes,
not deep like you, fixed on my glasses rim.
I understood then flowers and butterflies
Weren't beautiful, weren't anything, to him.



 VALENTINE WISH

The morning after, here's a valentine.
Shall I stamp it playfully in snow;
to see it lost in winter's next mean blow?
I want a more endeared, enduring sign
so I may scribble it across the wall.
But then next cleaning day we lose it all.
Or proudly publish it in someone's book,
a great report where anyone might look.
Perhaps I'd chisel it upon the street
Outrageous, public, permanent, concrete;
or  rather lost in pockets one that  goes
where you go, shows up like a fine
reminder of one time, a simple line
not thrown away. Let it be one of those.




421
IN TUNE

musical notes
are dancing on the page
when only you
can loose the
from that cage

You full of life
life is a song
but some of the notes
held long

PATTERNS OF THOUGHT

Patterns of thought
a maple tree  
top branches
gone all bare 
against a sky
of clear and cloud
in singing air
without a stir 
the morning 
comes so clean
with something secret 
in the scene
the  birdnest
in lower branches
still with leaves
common enough
the sparrow flies
and chirps 
and grieves
