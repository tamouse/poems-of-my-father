  <div class="poem-body"><p>What am I leading on my string?
Is it a calf my father
Made it mine
	special attention
	constant care
	something like love
		milk-fed
vealed at four months</p>

<p>Is it a rabbit
	to catch in a wire snare
	I had read about it
	followed the directions
	made one
	it didnâ€™t work</p>

<p>Is it a stick of wood
	constant, unchanging
	keeping the carved letters
	of the new three-blade jack knife
	lost a week later</p>

<p>Is it another string
	and then another string
	so all the vealed
escaped			lost
	episodes go back and back
	a soiled concatenation
		of knots</p>
