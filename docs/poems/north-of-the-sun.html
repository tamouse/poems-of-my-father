Emptly envelope
letter opened yesterday
skin of a secret</p>

<p>ii
Last yearâ€™s calendar
all its secrets told and done
growing in heart-held value</p>

<p>Remembrance goes on
song of a sparrow heard still
after the songbird has flown</p>

<p>iii
shadows reach farther
after the heat of the day
heartaches are deeper
after the strength of the having
rest is the time for sorrow</p>

<p>Broken lines written
first in the soft easy clay
before the chisel
hammered white knuckled in stone
breaks in to last a lifetime</p>

<p>II  i
she will remember
her son in the city square
dreamer and student</p>

<p>ii
he had ideas
argumentative, learner
pushing for explanation
not like the others
happy to work to be told
he listened had to question</p>

<p>iii
he traveled from home
many miles seeking answers
wrote letters to her
strong in his love for them all
now no more letters arrive</p>

<p>all he had written
hidden away in a box
stored as a treasure
precious as rarest of stone
suffer this wealth a lifetime</p>

<p>III  i
stronger her love now
for the one who journeyed away
resting far from her</p>

<p>ii
her sorrow is strength
she grows in understanding
of why that son departed
looks at his old books
childhood readings and studies
knows his reasons for dying</p>

<p>iii
a passion for life
outweighed by measures of death
she hears his questions
she talks outloud to his chair
puts her hand on his pillow</p>

<p>he lives in her mind
what she knows now of learning
she loves deeply holds
firm ideas for living
will not see dying easy</p>
