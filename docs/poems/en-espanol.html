  <div class="poem-body"><p>She stood upon the city square, she knelt
To travel that whole distance on her knees
To demonstrate the piety she felt</p>

<p>The stones were rough, unswept; an unhealed welt
On one knee bled.  To catch a bit of breeze
She stood up.  On the city square she knelt,</p>

<p>Continued on her prayerful way, strong-willed,
Across the pavement, hoping pain would please
To demonstrate the piety she felt.</p>

<p>The ones she loved had been so much at fault–
Grandchildren, nephews–burdens she might  She stood
up on the city square. She knelt,</p>

<p>Two blocks to go. She would absolve their guilt,
Do anything to help–as faith decrees–
To demonstrate the piety she felt.</p>

<p>For this a great cathedral had been built,
One spire three hundred feet above the trees.
She stood upon the Zocalo, she knelt
To demonstrate the piety she felt.</p>
