  <div class="poem-body"><p><em>( an archeologist finds a tiny
fertility goddess long buried )</em></p>

<p>Antique respect for hope and birth
perhaps a symbol of the wise
at any rate it has lost the worth
and calm clear light behind the eyes</p>

<p>the legs are smooth
smooth too the bust
above it is rough
this tiny size
demanding love
and more
demanding trust</p>

<p>what has been lost
oh what a storm
of promised pulse
of swell and thrust
we do not even care
now form
is all, is all.</p>
