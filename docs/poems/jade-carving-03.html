  <div class="poem-body"><p>A palace of rocks, the sun-storm wind
Has swept the resting valley clear.
Life fights  for holds at timberline;</p>

<p>The soil around the small roots thinned.
The harvest age of the mountain year
Continues with work of birch and pine.</p>

<p>Here is the home, the private place,
We pause by the woodsman andwe hear
His echoed song fromt he tall rock face.</p>
