  <div class="poem-body"><p>One baking day
on  county roads
when bikng was admenture,
we made it to the tower
on the mountain;
walking mostly,
pushing those strong bikes
with new departure coaster brakes
up that painful road
to the lookout tower,</p>

<p>the road mocked now
by cable rides and ski runs
for people nobody knows
to use the mountain
which has for them
the proper conformation:
See Dick Ski</p>

<p>That’s how it’s gone
for most of us,
conformation
is the use of us
of most of us,</p>
