  <div class="poem-title">Potato Juice</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Potato juice
you’ll never be able to sell potato juice
like to drink you mean
dispensers come with four spigots
and even to add water
you have to run in an extra line
the stores are full of varieties of drinks
potatoes are used as chips fries
but juice
that’s like trying to sell tomato chips
no it’s not a great idea
i said that to show you how ridiculous
no you can’t use my name
you’re fighting all the customs
all the rules of food
that people are used to
potato juice and tomato chips are absolutely
impossible
the sexy odor
ok
but that doesn’t mean
people will want to drink it
wear it maybe</p>

<p>potato perfume
I didn’t mean to
I was just trying to stop you from
no potato perfume won’t sell
yes, it’s sexy
but
as cologne
try Pop’s Schnapps
oh I didn’t mean that
no you can’t use it
on Spud’s duds
forget it
please just go on marketing your chips
and fries
will you that’s enough
you want to go into the perfume business
no I don’t think someone else will take the idea and
run with it
no you can’t say
beauty is in the eye of the potato
the eye of the potato
is used to start a new plant
it isn’t any special product
it’s sort of like a belly button
just a hole</p>

<p>no you can’t grow a new person
that isn’t what I said
I know how to grow a new person
potato juice won’t help
potato eyes are a method
for non sexual reproduction
potato sculpture
grow those knobby potatoes
you get that by letting them dry out
part of the season
from lack of rain
before irrigation
you can’t control that
you think you can inject water
I wonder if people could take potatoes
that seriously
funny shapes
comic sculpture
red brown russet
round and oblong
Idaho doesn’t mean anything
they just brag about them to sell them
any other state does as well</p>

<p>Potato Cream Pie
potato relish
that’s possible
that’s the best idea so far
in fact it’s the only one worth
no
I’m not going to listen to this
yes
people have always used potatoes
as stoppers on gas cans
but
a good filter yes
deodorant yes
but no
I dont want to hear what potato pads
would be good for
I don’t want to hear all the uses
I’m not listening</p>
