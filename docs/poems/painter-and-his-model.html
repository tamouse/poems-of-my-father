  <div class="poem-body"><p>At first her gaze of love was but pretense.
Had she intended only to adore
An outward version of me, not the core
Where passions melt the bedrock of events
Where dreaming shapes reshapes to private sense
Then I had not been changed, and change before
All other forces will occur the more
I do of any present consequence.</p>

<p>So surface quality of this affair
Was not her way â€“ my brushes made a scene
That, while increasingly aware
Of what my pencils drew, I drew. Embraced
By deeper care, to me she came to mean
The landscape, foreground, action of my space.</p>
