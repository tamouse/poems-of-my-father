  <div class="poem-title">Haiku of April 8, 1997</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p><em>1</em>
loons cry
across flat swamp
blueberries</p>

<p><em>2</em>
irgin coral forvest
upwells, nourishes
inner city hood</p>

<p><em>3</em>
plant the brick
next to the other brick
room between for grass</p>

<p><em>4</em>
step on my body
prone to punishment
pressed to earth</p>

<p><em>5</em>
shift down
grind metal teeth spit gravel
at the past</p>

<p><em>6</em>
knee thigh
warm new
already taken</p>

<p><em>7</em>
spindle sharp curse
blood condition
only a hundred years</p>

<p><em>8</em>
thief searches
othersâ€™ possession not valued
take</p>

<p><em>10</em>
shoveling snow
light inside
diamonds</p>

<p><em>11</em>
silver and green
leaves of silver poplar
imitating   maple</p>

<p><em>12</em>
hot chocolate
with marshmallows
jungle and swamp</p>

<p><em>13</em>
frying pan spider
whatchamacallitthingy
the eggs are up</p>

<p><em>14</em>
drifts so deep
in over my head
what else is new</p>

<p><em>15</em>
butcher paper
wraps a candy valentine
presence of blood</p>

<p><em>16</em>
flood covers everything
as far as we can see
even worms and bugs</p>

<p><em>17</em>
periferal vision
lost
one pixel at a time</p>

<p><em>18</em>
crib back to the attic
after all the waiting time
no sleep</p>

<p><em>haiku 19  of  4/18/97</em>
no one trims this grass
all the folks have gone away
except one who died</p>

<p><em>haiku 20  of  4/18/97</em>
airplane overhead
snuggle remember far places
under the blankets</p>

<p><em>haiku 1 of 4/11</em>
Loss of central vision.
child asks have to wear glasses
No such luck.</p>

<p><em>haiku 2 of 4/11</em>
Macular degeneration
will there be a treatment
More ozone.</p>
