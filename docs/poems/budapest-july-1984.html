  <div class="poem-title">Budapest, July 1984</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Half a circle round the bus-tour guide
Inside his own half circle, where the great men
enstone his country’s history in pride,
some children scramble on and off again
away from earth a little, climb, leap. land
The guide seems somewhat bothered by it all
He gestures with his head, hand held in hand
the hidden fingers where… the hand so small?</p>

<p>He praises these great men, a cut-off tale
great empire shrunk to dominated form,
the silicon age the children scale
our guide oh no, forgetting , raises his arm
forgotten hand, or hand he can not find
to point to one more statue of a king;
not gesture with, No tourist mind</p>

<p>provides such closure.  Not some little thing
a metal form, carved wood, to fit a glove
		to show concern,
one child his wrist bent in play…
not what this government was thinkng of…
a child’s sleeved arm points handless our guide’s way.</p>
