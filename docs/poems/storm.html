<p>you listen as the windows shake
harder than you’ve heard before
The panes, you wonder, will they break</p>

<p>Again that sound, Wind? Nothing more?
A coldness coming in the door
You listen as the windows shake</p>

<p>Again the sound, wind, nothing more?
Are you the only one awake
Is something blowing off the lake</p>

<p>Again that sound, wind? Nothing more?
you listen as the windows shake
will what is blowing reach the shore</p>

<p>Again the sound, wind? Nothing more?
What does the morning hold in store
You listen as the windows shake.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>You slowly walk among the trees
you hear no sound you feel no breeze
Where nothing grows in this dark shade
no petal shines, no merest blade
you slowly walk among the trees
where nothing grows in this deep shade
the bushes hide a sound that flees
here nothing grows in this deep shade
you slowly walk among the trees
is there a sound, you are afraid
where nothing grows in htis deep shade
wtih mossy softness to your knees
advancing on, armed with a spade
you slowly walk among the trees.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>I’m walkng down a country road
to visit my big sister’s niece
this  puts me in a frightened mode
old gravel slippery as grease
this truly is a tricky piece
I’m driving down a country road
old gravel slippery as grease
the engine steams and may explode
the mud builds up an overload
old gravel slippery as grease
I’m driving down a country road
where lonely dangers will not cease
old gravel slippery as grease
I’m so alone a startled toad
and overhead a V of geese
I’m driving down a country road</p>

<p>how like a new and strange disease
you spend a lifetime to forget
it  overtakes you like a sneeze
the body pays this years old debt
more evidence now, on it weaves
it’s like a new and strange disease
my body has this years old debt
the aged are so hard to please
the geese have broken their high Vs
my body has this years old debt
its like a new and strange disease
no use to worry so and fret
my body has this years old debt
now adding up in vain decrees
time and I we’ve scarcely met
it’s like a new and strange disease</p>
