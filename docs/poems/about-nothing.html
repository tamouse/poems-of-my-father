  <div class="poem-title">About Nothing</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>when I was six and reading
aloud to the class
and to the teacher
to prove
I was there</p>

<p>the word NOTHING
lay upon the page
with no clue within its sentence
within its context
with no way to pronounce:
No THING
sure to be a snicker</p>

<p>yes, that was what it meant</p>

<p>then the teacher
anxious to cut short
the silence
rowdy-type students
are eager to fill</p>

<p>gave it to me
NUTHING</p>
