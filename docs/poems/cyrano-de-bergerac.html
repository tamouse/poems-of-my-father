  <div class="poem-body"><p>You are still with us – artists near and far
remember and respond to your staged call,
between panache and rhyme contestants spar
win honor’s victories – unworthies fall.
While Montfleury remains the sad buffoon
the count returns to make his late adieu.
Now to the last of those who would lampoon
the fool – extol the true – add Dépardieu.
Through many characters his skills extend.
The role’s magnificence is why we came,
courageous acts have brought us to attend
upon this presentation’s fresh acclaim.
How fortunate for worlds of life and show
Rostand picked  up your old book, Cyrano.</p>
