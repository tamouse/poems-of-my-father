  <div class="poem-body"><p>I have been chosen,   I at age sixteen
the Keeper of the Sun has sent a guard
to bring me to what no one here has seen
a busy place which is all house and yard.
This honor so esteemed for me–it’s hard
to understand, accept.   I go alone.
the first step, the great road, all polished stone</p>

<p>They take me. Mother kisses, father hands
me things: corn, sack of beans. His eyes are wet.
That   I am chosen out of all these lands:
an honor he and   I will not forget.
Now my soul mother, who taught me,   I let
her hands dress me once more,
		in feathered shells.
No longer simple, life in me foretells</p>

<p>Some act of greatness. Now, announcers shout.
The leader of the guard says “Time to start.”
Sunrise it is, the guard and   I set out.
So proud   I am this day. Who wants my heart
Shall have it. and my strength, blood, part
Yes any of me, flesh or bone or thought.
More glory here than anyone has sought</p>

<p>We walk all day, next day, until five hours
past the second sunrise, skies in flame,
like flame too tree-high, higher, city towers.
Gods must have put them here. I cannot name
those gods; I only know why good rains came
and corn and sun, those gods.
		Now awed but weak,
past ancient worded walls that almost speak.</p>

<p>Now closer to the towers, I see rich rooms,
and ruling places, stones for sacrifice
With high steep climbs.
		Tall men wearing plumes
stand by me, take me. All gods have a price.
The body that was mine is theirs, is ice.
The Keeper cuts himself, stands high as sir.
Cuts tongue, an ear, and now; oh,no, look where.</p>

<p>Must he unsex himself? No, just three cuts
from which the blood now covers him, all red.
A field of people shout and cry. He struts
as I resume my climb, the guards ahead,
behind, to help. The Keeper close, not dead.
At last I stand where he stood. Cut, a stain
drips on me. Honored clothing gone. The pain.</p>
