  <div class="poem-body"><p>Ginette had said the most disturbing thing:
“Guess what? Won’t need this window when I’m dead”
“What’s this? What put that notion in your head?”
“I’ll walk through windows, see through walls. They’ll
bring
My coffin here, I’ll hop right out. I’ll jump
On to your lap and you won’t even know–
I’ll snuggle close to you…”  “My God, my dear,
Must you go on!” I said.  “Oh, you  old grump…”
She called me that when she felt picked on. “Oh,
You grump!”  We said all this…  was it last year?
I wash this window, wash this window, bring
My chair to sit here next to hers–my head
Filled with one racking question: When we’re dead,
Do we need windows?   …walls, or anything?</p>
