  <div class="poem-body"><p>Closed
closed and locked
brick monuments
together
make a city</p>

<p>Her buddy
don’t rattle that door
might set off the alarm</p>

<p>Closed
closed and locked
even the church</p>

<p>Hey buddy
this is half-past one
service is over</p>

<p>Closed
the river cave
blocked by boulders</p>

<p>Her buddy
don’t move that stone
someone might get in there</p>

<p>Knoll of pines
opens invites
place to listen</p>

<p>Slope of sumac
hiding black currants
red currants
permits, preovides</p>

<p>Shoe moves
shoe on a kid
hiding in bushes
ashes dropping
through an open shirt</p>

<p>Sneak out here
and burn
burn his nature
burn my nature
chimney it
through lungs</p>

<p>Cluster of monuments
city of locks
chimneys of death</p>
