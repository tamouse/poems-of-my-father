  <div class="poem-body"><p>We waited such a long time for your call
We jumped each time the senseless phone
		would ring
Each car door slamming was another wall</p>

<p>Of time built up around us–time to crawl
Through hours till morning–frightened
		time to  cling
We waited such a long time for your call</p>

<p>We held our breath and heard small
		sounds grow tall
We wondered what the next mail truck
		might bring
Each car door slamming was another wall</p>

<p>The sirens wailing were the worst of all
The come-and-go: a child’s gone-crazy swing
We waited such a long time for your call</p>

<p>How heavy silence is in its slow fall
How long life is when measured by its sting
Each car door slamming was another wall</p>

<p>Those sirens with that manic high-pitched bawl
What can they mean in memory anything?
We waited such a long time for your call
Each car door slamming was another wall</p>
