That’s good, they’ll say, Another one of those.
He cannot show them what they do not see.</p>

<p>No prophet, only one who started free
but early learned obedience and chose
what they can understand is what he’ll be.</p>

<p>For his own vision he will make no plea
as if what others know is all he knows.
He cannot show them what they do not see.</p>

<p>They have some forms with which  they all agree.
Each door to new adventure they will close.
What they can understand is what he’ll be.</p>

<p>In his own mind range forms from A to Z.
Beyond the world their public thoughts explore
he cannot show them what they do not see.</p>

<p>They do not want a window or a key
so leaving them in self-induced repose
what they can understand is what he’ll be.
He cannot show them what they do not see.</p>
