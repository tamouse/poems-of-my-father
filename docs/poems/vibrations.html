  <div class="poem-title">Vibrations</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Vibrations all around us live and strong
we were the ones who heard and kept the beat
with rhythms of the hopes the words repeat
a lifetime and each moment capped with song
if in the day to day the words went wrong
we found comfort in the music we heard sweet
but that unheard wasâ€¦
		something penned by Keats
with harmonies we have remembered long</p>

<p>Publicly the wonder of the seeds
speak to a world in paradigm
in metaphor of how things ought to be
privately we share our secret needs
so when the massive echoes of the hymn
have faded; Piper, pipe a song for me.</p>
