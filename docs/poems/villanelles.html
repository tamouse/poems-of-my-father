  <div class="poem-body"><p><strong>Introduction to a Long Sequence of Villanelles</strong></p>

<p>The painter, what parallel unpolared place
did he perceive, yet dare not quite reveal;
 with what senses did that child feel
                    before the artist God-like had erased.</p>

<p>Did this unheard-from brother want to try
   the powers that make us what we are or seem
to be; the colored flights of old forgotten dreams;
where were the loves he needed standing by?
Into what world of love has he returned
   unfulfilled, all he might be, unlearned?</p>

<p><strong>I</strong></p>

<p>How did it happen that we lost the song?
forgot the flesh inside the ghosts we saw?
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.</p>

<p>We paid each bill. Each task that came along
We took, we listened, followed every law.
How did it happen that we lost? The song</p>

<p>Goes on – each measure then was strong
and stronger still with every breath we’d draw
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.</p>

<p>We thought the best of living would belong
to us. Indeed, perfection without flaw.
How did it happen?
           That we lost the song</p>

<p>is obvious as we have known so long.
Caresses now revert to skin rubbed raw.
Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.</p>

<p>Between us is a tattered hope gone wrong.
How did it happen that we lost the song?</p>

<p><strong>II</strong></p>

<p><strong>Paperweight</strong></p>

<p>When night turned over, it began to snow.
  Still, all your friends knew what to talk about.
  I left a child I thought you’d like. To know</p>

<p>each other seemed a little way to go.
 Too far to be forgiven, it turned out.
 When night turned over, it began to snow.</p>

<p>The sky changed color, greyed-off orange glow
with darker streaks
		–then you found voice to shout.
I left. A child I thought you’d like to know</p>

<p>came, ready to play and ready to grow.
It was almost as if we’d picked him out.
When night turned over, it began to snow.</p>

<p>A mind gives birth, though no one proves it so.
A figment sharing want, wait, dream, and doubt.
I left a child I thought.
                        You’d like to know</p>

<p>A child – a flesh and blood child head to toe;
as baby, reader, runner, spender, scout.
When night turned over, it began to snow.
I left a child I thought you’d like to know</p>

<p><strong>III</strong></p>

<p>When, after hours, we stayed awake and tried
 with what poor means
		or lack of means we found
 to deal with life: What life? I laughed, you cried</p>

<p>for you held so much more than I inside.
 We never did meet on an even ground.
 When after hours we stayed awake and tried</p>

<p>to play each other, testing love, defied
what others might consider safe and sound
to deal with live. What life? I laughed. You cried</p>

<p>No more pretense, no more one of us tied
on to the other; both in one death drowned.
When after hours we stayed awake and tried</p>

<p>while all our senses seemed to override
what our own actions made our lives expound
to deal with life, “What life?” I laughed.
                                                 You cried</p>

<p>to deal with life. I took it all in stride.
You were too much to your own values bound
when after hours we stayed awake and tried
to deal with life. “What life?”:
		I laughed, you cried.</p>

<p><strong>IV</strong></p>

<p>After that I thought about the child
What kind of life he’d have if he were real
and partly civilized but mostly wild.</p>

<p>Not part of our life, hurting and defiled;
with pain that even time seems not to heal.
After that I thought about the child</p>

<p>living on without me. Once I dialed
a number where he might be living. He’ll
be partly civilized but mostly wild,</p>

<p>I told myself, a muscled full life, styled
on ax and hammer, sinew, fire and steel.
After that I thought about the child</p>

<p>small in my arms, small in my life, beguiled
and reaching for what living might reveal
partly civilized but mostly wild:</p>

<p>wild like meadows, birds, like seas green-isled,
yet tame to hear what people say they feel.
After that I thought about the child
As partly civilized but mostly wild.</p>

<p><strong>V</strong></p>

<p>How we have hoped together, love, for years
When only moments now and then come by.
We have not cared enough. Between our fears</p>

<p>Of loving and our love, what interferes
  is so much loss which leaves us both to cry:
How we have hoped together, love, for years.</p>

<p>That life we thought we’d found,
		which now appears
had love too long left out, for you and I,
we have not dared enough. Between our fears</p>

<p>of separation and reunion, leers
the monster loneliness. We but but reply
how we have coped together love for years.</p>

<p>Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
Where have our lives gone? No time left to try.
We have not shared enough. Between our fears</p>

<p>Admitting what we now say, no one hears;
We have not shared enough. Between our fears.</p>

<p><strong>VI</strong></p>

<p>On nights that I was animal, and you
sang me into human form again,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.</p>

<p>Those many nights my wilder form outgrew
attempts to hold me, none could be my friend.
On nights that I was animal, and you</p>

<p>into another world in fear withdrew
 with other knowledge without where or when,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.</p>

<p>The storming rage you had to see me through,
my deepest wrath–I was not loving then–
On nights that I was animal.  And you</p>

<p>you had the hardest time, yet somehow knew
to conquer those strange weaknesses of men.
You helped my heart its nobler sense renew.</p>

<p>That I have wronged you, all would say is true,
yet would you sing, my faults you would defend
On nights that I was animal.  And you,
you helped my heart its nobler sense renew.</p>
