  <div class="poem-title">The Sweeper at Chartres</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>The tall statue,
mournful but beautifully at peace
on the main facade of Chartres
got very tired one day of standing for centuries
in one crowded niche among other saints
and slipped to the ground</p>

<p>standing without support from the church
was difficult – he hadn’t anticipated
difficulties so trivial –
he lay on the ground for a while
before crowds were to be milling about
wanting to look at him.</p>

<p>the sweeper came along cleaning up the debris
of all those crowds with his green broom
what to do with this fallen statue
so heavy but he got it into his cart
and off he went stumbling
feeling his arms stretch</p>

<p>Before he got to the thing
he was to dump the load in
however he was himself completely stretched
His heart gave out; he fell stone dead.
He lay, he was as long  as the statue.
Authorities had quite a time figuring out
which statue to put back in the niche.</p>

<p>After global research,
they selected the wrong one
The first statue is now stones in a brook
singing praises of the universe
the second is among the saints
mournful but beautifully at peace
he is looking at an old green broom
near a construction shed; he would like a chance
to clean the street one more time</p>
