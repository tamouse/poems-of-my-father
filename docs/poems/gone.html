  <div class="poem-body"><p>I do not want them to be gone,
the friends Iâ€™ve had and lost.
Some say that they have traveled on
or that there is a bar they crossed.
I say come back we are not done,
I want to walk where they walk, not hostile
to the system, I simply do not want
a closure definite forever, wall
without a window or more calls
of any kind, at any cost
sealed beneath fake placid lawn,
it is so politely mocking, they are gone.</p>
