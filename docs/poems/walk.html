  <div class="poem-body"><p>We started out not thinking we would walk
so far, but step led on to step. A pair
of rabbits – are they not single, as one finds
them normally – each small white tip
of tail went under bushes disappeared
so neatly we weren’t sure what we had seen.</p>

<p>That got us started looking, what was seen?
So many surprising little things,
		a walk can bring you,
like new pavement cracks appeared
since yesterday, dandelions, a pesky pair
of thistles. Careful, dear, in taking off their tip.
A busy line of ants – one finds
ants everywhere. One even finds
them deeper under ground. I’ve seen
them four feet down, a nest. The tip
is all you see.  Now you walk
by where some small mounds built as a pair
of carefully arranged sand, has appeared.</p>

<p>Now that reminds me what the detective finds;
stockings and a pair
of undies, what else have we seen?
More than I want to talk about. A walk
is not the time, we see the tip,</p>

<p>a little proof of so much underneath. A tip
does not reveal much. It’s appeared
you may be ready. Not this walk. This walk
is not about what someone finds,
is not about what someone has seen,
is not about some stockings or a pair
of undies. We were a pair,
what are we now?  I feel the tip
of some shipwrecking iceberg, large, unseen
until too late, then appeared
with wreckage … all he finds
goes much farther than I meant this walk
to go: step by step, a pair.  What appeared
no more than a tip, what if one finds
what cannot be seen?
Walk.</p>
