  <div class="poem-title">Hamlin's Line</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>When Hamlin draws a line in thin air
his fingers trace a shape of strong allure
like nothing that has ever been before
we think we see what is not really there.</p>

<p>The shape becomes the life, the life of those
who tried to love him; loving him was all
they ever got to kjow of him..who knows
if he had more in him.  A pall
of vast unknowing–what they chose
to love was maybe real–or fictional.</p>

<p>He had no knack for drawing lines–his air
of acting like he knew–his sweet allure
let people think they knew him–loved him–for…
for what?  What they imagined, really, nothing there.</p>
