Nineteen eighty-one</p>

<p>My dear,</p>

<p>Just received your letter
with the news
that you will spend two weeks
in Mexico.
I’ll want to see your colored slides
when they are done;
you get so much of life
within each frame –
artist that you are.
You’ll like it there</p>

<p>and see no beggars
except a village mother now and then
with one child wrapped within a shawl.
Here’s hoping that you don’t get sick
or robbed;
and Oh, my dear,
be careful with your camera in Mexico.</p>

<p>While I was there
a two-year-old
escaped from her mother’s shawl.
Charming toddler,
trusting among strangers.</p>

<p>I stopped to time the light,
to frame the scene;
lucky, I thought, to be a witness.
The mother swept up the child,
angry that a photograph
would lift some of the spirit
to be printed on a paper,
leaving the beloved one diminished.</p>

<p>So she believed.</p>

<p>As that Dutch painter
went to France
and gave his mind
in bits
to canvases
So he believed.</p>

<p>Well, as for that,
how much of life
will be consumed
of anyone
who tries to grasp
the golden point of view</p>

<p>Oh, how I ramble on.
My dear,</p>

<p>Be careful
with your camera
in Mexico.</p>
