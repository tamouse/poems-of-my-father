  <div class="poem-body"><p>to draw a line where there has been no line
and such a line as clears a telling space
to make a song where there has been but sound</p>

<p>and such a song as reaches through the mind
to write some words with meaning out of sleep
with such a swelling thought that feelings trace</p>

<p>all words from other words their meanings build
let what we draw or write find solid base
let songs re-echo what will not be stilled</p>

<p>this is a task a person well may keep
so let us read and pass the book around
so let us sing and listen to such grace</p>

<p>as charms the air and comforts those who weep
as treasures care and lights a smiling face</p>
