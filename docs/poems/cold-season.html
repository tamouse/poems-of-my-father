  <div class="poem-title">Cold Season</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Drifts of winter cover roof and window,
wolves surround to choir moonlit glory,
human in their hunger and their hunt.
Huddled where we are, inside dark snow rooms
frightened; we are their game; they are not ours.</p>

<p>Then summer, dark and burden melt
to tasks we fall to; we are ever healthy to that
with the sun building harvest
from our working and our dirt.</p>

<p>In joy we turn to waste all we have won
except at night the grey beasts watch
to howl us winter comes again.</p>
