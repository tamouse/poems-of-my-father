  <div class="poem-body"><p>The places I remember far away
The places I remember that are near
All memories I lose each passing day</p>

<p>What was that lighted town, a bright display
Sky-high, it was? or so it did appear.
The places I remember far away</p>

<p>Where was that town they couldnâ€™t let us stay
They had a festival tat time of year.
All memories I lose each passing day</p>

<p>Who was that friend who taught us how to say
the foreign phrases we found so hard to hear.
The places I remember far away</p>

<p>A frame with  nothing in it, gone what may
More than regret, the emptying I fear
All memories I lose each passing day</p>

<p>I want back all that brightness gone to grey
Whole reaches of a life no longer clear.
The places I remember far away
All memories I lose each passing day</p>
