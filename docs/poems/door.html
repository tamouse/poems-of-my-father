  <div class="poem-body"><p>My front door opens to a load of speed,
of chases, deals, last-minute runs to get supplies
the sun sends baking pushing heat
to hasten what occurs.</p>

<p>My back door opens to a yard
of blooming weeds,
a sneaking rabbit with its bunny eyes
nibbles cautiously, but nibbles, eats
what I think of as mine: she knows itâ€™s hers</p>
