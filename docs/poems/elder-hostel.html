  <div class="poem-body"><p>Sunset after all day blended light
has hidden gold, strong yellow, orange red
shatters whiteness on the crest of night
hot colors blazing on their own death bed</p>

<p>autumn crowned in universal green
a neutral hiding flashings in the leaves.
consumed to show so lavish but unseen
rich colors day of cooling strength receives</p>

<p>lifetime, sober, dutifully spent
and hiding brightness, now from structure
intoxicated, what had old rules meant
espressions flung, sky falling fires born</p>

<p>the seasoned systems work with age-free prime
true colors that have been there all the time.</p>
