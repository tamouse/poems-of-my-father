  <div class="poem-body"><p>While you hold me
there will work no wrong
while I hold you
there will come no chill
your warmth is surer
than this very sun
a trust rekindles
as its fires cool</p>

<p>Keep me, then;
inside this worldâ€™s light
I grow in you
another life and realm
call help me when
I hear its cold invite
which I must welcome
or indeed untell</p>
