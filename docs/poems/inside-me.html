  <div class="poem-title">Inside Me</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>there’s a kid who lives inside me
who doesn’t like my life
he wasn’t ready for the things
that led to all this strife</p>

<p>there’s a kid who lives inside me
who keeps looking through my eyes
he tries to tell me where to go
and what to do, he tries</p>

<p>I pretend I haven’t even heard
the pesky way he nags
finally I tell him he’s absurd
so then he chokes, he gags</p>

<p>there’s a kid who lives inside me
who keeps listening through my ears
he teases me. he pesters me
he plays upon my fears</p>

<p>he keeps thinking that he has control
forgets he’s locked inside
he wants me to go swimming
to play ball to go and slide</p>

<p>he’s a loser he’s a pouter
he’s a loner he’s a kluts
he says I’m a down and outer
hanging idle smoking butts</p>

<p>get lost I tell him it’s my time
to develop with  my friend
you brat you dunce out of my heart
you force me to pretend</p>

<p>and then I think perhaps that kid
is part of  my life still
I remember all the things he did
but oh he can get shrill</p>

<p>he gets nasty nasty really weird
like almost gone insane
he stomps and says he’ll pull my beard
he shrieks inside my brain</p>

<p>he’ll stamp his feet upon my heart
he’ll stomp his feet and shout
he wants more of the acive part
or else he’s coming out</p>
