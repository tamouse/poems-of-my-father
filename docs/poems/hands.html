  <div class="poem-title">Hands</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>My hands have just held a poem
                        by a friend about her hands.
                        Her hands want to be Italian
                        everybody loves Italian
                        My hands feel Russian
                        having just dropped the fork
                        clattering to the plate
                        they remember the heft
                        of the shovel in the garden
                        Dinner forks take such finesse.</p>

<p>Her hands help her read outloud
                        My hands hang onto the lectern
                        one sneaks inside my shirt
                        I stand there like Napoleon
                        it thinks something important
                        might get said</p>

<p>and it offers
                        a little of the ridiculous
                        for balance
                        to realize later gestures
                        would have helped.
                        My hands like to pretend
                        the tight cramp
                        of violinistsâ€™  fingers but are only
                        good for rooting quackgrass
                        for holding boards for hammers</p>

<p>My hands grasp rough stovewood
                        while thinking about being
                        a nest for injured birds
My hands have age-spots diguised as freckles
My hands would like to crawl off into grass
 to creep up on cats
 as clenchers, squeezers
 holders, bangers
 tools for the tough trade
 where they let push come to shove.</p>

<p>My hands meet hands of friends and
strangers to hold me off.
My hands have never been raised in
hold-ups or for rescue from drowning
But often in recitation about such things.
When I sleep my hands grasp the bedposts
holding still the tossing night
until the level light of morning.
My hands marvelously efficient creatures,
how did I come to have hands like these.</p>

<p>Except along the back: conduits,
great wall of China, the trade of empires
the great flow.
Storms inside:
Maelstroms of crashing cargo
Colossal corpuscle-jams
followed by magnificent breakings-loose
thunderous.</p>
