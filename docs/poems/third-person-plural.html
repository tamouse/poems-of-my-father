  <div class="poem-title">Third Person Plural</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>I have too many fathers
every week or two a new one
mother brings in another
she doesn’t pile them up much
one at a time actually three or four
on her string at one time
no one-night stands-class of person here
not cheap –dont read this for a cheap thrill
bug off  it aint here
my elbow to you</p>

<p>some like to pretend
they are married to her
what I meant by too many father
so they pretend with me too
I’m always around
really here constantly the kid
to whatever parental action is happening</p>

<p>up early getting breakfast
three mos of the time
go ahead make three
don’t ask don’t bother
about seven-thirty make noises
create a good food smell
breakfast clatter
milk cereal for me</p>

<p>mother toast eggs juice coffee
third breakfast
never an order
three-egg omelet
Texas toast oatmeal potatoes
sausage  a killer</p>

<p>if the big third breakfast goes begging
I have a big lunch
dont’ go to school on those days
mom and me alone telling stories
watching morning soaps
snuggled together
lots of food
Good time just the two of us
but if the third breakfast person
wants to hang around hang out
then goof to whatever else
he pretends to be
me the naive kid
helpful easy hug me
if mother is there ok
hugs without mother right there bug off
the elbow to the macho rib cage
not gradual
a first strike situation
I ain’t out to lose
–no sex abuse here–
bug off-read a different story– bug off–</p>

<p>School calls to remind us
morning is getting serious
about arriving
I go at least every two weeks
to avoid getting on lists
as one who is thoroughly out
to beat the system
often enough so the school
gets paid for having you
– act up bad so teachers
won’t care whether you show up.</p>

<p>What mother wants to do
when she gets rich
is go to London
for weeks walk fancy
eat artichokes
the right way
get so
proper people will watch her
to see which fork to use
charge admission
to her living room
highest price to those
at her feet who touch her furs</p>

<p>what a dreamer, my mother.</p>
