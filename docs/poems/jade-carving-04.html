  <div class="poem-body"><p>A palace of rocks an cordwood piled
High for the seasoned to be shipped.
A working sun rides hot and brihgt</p>

<p>High is best for life in the wild,
Bare were rock and snow have lsipped
Cutting a path to the hard-won height.</p>

<p>Where man must ever live out-guest
Below the highest rock wind-stripped,
Where cold clear green arrives refreshed.</p>
