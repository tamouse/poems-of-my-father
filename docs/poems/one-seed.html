<p>Begin in one corner
of the lawn
–the lawn that is perfect
level green–
in one corner
put a blade of grass
that is different
a darker green 	taller not so straight
plant another
discover a third
allow it to thrive
do not mow this corner
water it  before three days pass
add another or allow another
do not mow even if a leaf gets to be
as high as your head
add new grasses
every third day at least
small animals will visit
when neighbors come
lie to them softly
that your experiment
will not last much longer
allow your grasses
to take your whole lawn
a prairie waving
in the wind
larger animals
          may call
a stand of brush
with all colors
red even purple branches
flowers from toes
to higher than your reach
when the government agent arrives
help him into the center of your lawn
with the grass shining over his head
leave him
while you investigate your bushes
for hazelnuts and service berries
careful not to step on nests
collect seeds
a few of many kinds
when the government mower arrives
keep another collection
of seeds
in a secret envelope
when they have processed you
into the walled-around yard
find one corner
where you may plant
one seed</p>
