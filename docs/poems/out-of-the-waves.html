give them today
just one more day
we’ll see about the morning
in the morning</p>

<p>give them today
one cycled sun
some hours won
we’ll see about the morning
in the morning</p>

<p>give them today
a certain bed
a body fed
their fear unsaid
give them today
their daily bread
we’ll see about the morning
in the morning</p>
