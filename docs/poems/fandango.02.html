  <div class="poem-body"><p>Then Angeline came to the rescue
she was bright she was light she was grand
with a dance that was pure Abaresque
she knew how to wait how to stand
this is not yet a true old fandango
for that you must have a small band</p>

<p>but she danced what she could
with what music
the family could find close at hand
a kettle, a stick, and a bouncing
soft ball and a soup of popular brand</p>

<p>if this is not quite a fandango
it’s as close as you’re likely to get
so come now grandfather and dance this
you must not just rest when you’re set
get up on your feet give an elbow
and feet then a hand bend a knee
yes that’s good you bet
stay away from the pots on the table
or we might all go home soaking wet.</p>
