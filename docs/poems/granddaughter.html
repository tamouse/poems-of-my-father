  <div class="poem-body"><p>Spinning in cloth of wonder child I grow
with; backyard swingset, sandpile, garden, tree,
Our bench. We sit, hear humming one slow bee;
So deep in profuse clover can it know
How strung to threadbare land and sky we go,
Ragged together, hemming sand to sea,
Spider to tailor; nothing free or free
To lose for all things lend as all things owe.</p>

<p>Warm blanket life, each child unknowing wraps
Near perfect patterns we all have, but one
By one fall tangled years. A dream perhaps
That only children know: the world is spun.
Granddaughter, young enough to understand
That we reach upward for a loving hand</p>
