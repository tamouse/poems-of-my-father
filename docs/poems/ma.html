  <div class="poem-body"><p>I remember her mopping the floor
after some dire accident probably
caused by me and  I asked ‘do you
love me’ and she could only shrug.
I remember telling her one morning
we had stayed at Hartman’s that my
new pants were terrible.  She was
so disappointed that I didn’t like them
until I explained that they could be
torn and were therefore tearible.</p>

<p>She repeated this to Miss Hartman.
I remember coming home with a
paper with colored dots and telling
Ma it was a secret club I had joined.
She told me not to have anything to
do with anyone who said  I should
not tell her about something.
I remember her smiling as part of the
audience watching me in the
kindergarten play about the toys that
came to life when the shopkeeper
left.   I was the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>I remember wondering what she
would say, but I don’t remember what
she DID say, when I broke my new</p>

<p>pencil box with the sliding roll-up
cover over the head of another kid.
I remember she found bugs in the
flour drawer.
I remember being underfoot in
the kitchen playing with the butter
boxes with Janice.
I remember her seeing the wren
when it returned for another summer
in the nest by the kitchen window.
I remember her teaching me the
child’s prayer about dying before I
wake… and not being too frightened.
(As Huck Finn would have said “If she
can stand it, I can.”</p>

<p>I remember her worn shoes and  the corns.
I remember her taking care of us when
we were lined up on the floor taking
turns throwing up from the flu
and how it took me a long time
to like baloney after that.
I remember joining Janice in
wailing about how awful the string
beans were.
I remember the chocolate drops
she brought home from town.
The biggest sack of candy to be found</p>
