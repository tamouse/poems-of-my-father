they hold each others’ hand.
They cannot float at sea
with all its hopes and fears;</p>

<p>they dare not come to land
as firm as that appears:
this world is of a size
for those like you and me.</p>

<p>But each one hundred years–
oh, maybe two or three–
one giant gets to stand
inside one human’s eyes.</p>
