  <div class="poem-body"><p>I lie upon this earth
possessed
by rock by swamp</p>

<p>I give my warmth
to this absorbing ground</p>

<p>I close on death
I dart</p>

<p>I put my body
into soil
in trust to water
loved by working air</p>

<p>I think of grapes
of yellow
bells
of leaves
I gather growths of stem
to myself</p>

<p>Left open
to a life I crave</p>

<p>a gasping flame
may eat the rain
I am not strong
or brave</p>

<p>Shaken from home
and bed all whimpering</p>

<p>wild wild
to stay
I can walk
one breath of time
solacing and deep</p>

<p>but I cannot decide
that I decide
that is a counsel
someone else must keep</p>

<p>A snake in triple S
writes my name
in script the flighted redowl
in gawping dives
through clouds
pretends
to read</p>

<p>to bring
to striding guardians
a thirteen striped
flapped parchment
to be signed
with
sticks
that bleed</p>

<p>to bring
to striding guardians
