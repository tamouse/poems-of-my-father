  <div class="poem-body"><p>The gods, we thought, are pleased,
		for a majestic beast
that towered on the sea
		was coming from the east
to visit us.  We saw a worm upon its skin–
no, those were crawling men
		who somehow lived within.</p>

<p>They had no birth or death–no woman came along,
but they took ours.
	They did not know that it is wrong
to take our women; take our goods,
		to take and thieve…
such alien behavior.</p>

<p>They could not achieve
plain fatherhood alone but on our common beach
each took a turn upon each maid;
		then went to reach
For yellow metal things of ours we did not use
except to fasten feathers.</p>

<p>We could afford to lose
this stuff, we learned to let them have it;
		brought with smiles
to them what water-rounded stones we had…
		small piles
grew on their decks.</p>

<p>411
	     We did not let them see the plumes
within our forest cache;
		the sacred tree-made rooms
of truly valued stock.</p>

<p>At last one day they left.
They had not learned of the most horrid,
		dreaded theft:
the sacred feathers.</p>

<p>What they did take, had not much
to do with life; but left with us a stronger touch
of death.  They could undo us, cut us all apart
with magic sticks that they could stab into a heart
or slice off arms,
	           or point a hand-sized thunder blast
straight into us with angry slashing teeth.</p>

<p>The last
we saw of them, they floated off.
			A sickness in our men
and women stayed behind.
		To make them whole again
we gathered in
	     our Clearing-Of-All-Wrongs around
the dead and dying with our drums and masks.</p>

<p>We found
that using what our wisest shaman knew
			– till dawn
we tried –  that all the cures went bad:
		our gods were gone.</p>
