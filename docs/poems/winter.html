<p>It snowed and snowed
on city park
and street. Hills glowed
through fingered bark,
grays blurred on white.
Our window showed
the longest night
not really dark.</p>

<p>When you were down,
ill, color gone,
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets stamped to stone
we skated on.</p>

<p>(version II)</p>

<p>Because it snowed
in city park
and street–hills glowed
through fingered bark
with grays on white–
our window showed
the longest night
not really dark.</p>

<p>When you were down
strength all but gone
we, we alone,
saw icicle town
streets packed to stone
we skated on</p>
