  <div class="poem-body"><p>Hemingway, my dear attentive students
wrote the story “Old Man and the Sea.”
You’ve read it now, I’m sure,
	for I assigned it.
Tell me what the messge seemed to be.</p>

<p>A silence from the class
	of high-school juniors
waiting for the lecturer to go
still on and on, it surely would go on
so much to explicate, so much to show.</p>

<p>The fish, the wounded hands,
	the shouldered mast
you see it, don’t you,
how ‘Old Man” was cast?
Some students nodding gravely
	clearly followed
each idea, everything I said
while others only had the fun of knowing
something big had passed them overhead</p>

<p>One student closed his book so quick so loud
in anger, I perceived, disturbed and proud.
I don’t remember him, so many classes,
his lips were firm with something held in check.
He had blue model paint flecks on his glasses,
something softly trembled in his neck.
Then he asked twice
a simple question: Who
are… you.. ?  Who are you?</p>
