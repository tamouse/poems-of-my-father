  <div class="poem-body"><p>Cars in the parking lot  do not sleep,
thumbs of light off glass and chrome
stab into offoces amd classrooms
studying shoulders, backs, and necks:
people are delicious,
cars have recipes.</p>

<p>Welcoming the people
who crawl willingly
into over-cushioned stomachs
to hide what they will do;
some slowly disappear
a satisfying meal.</p>

<p>Waiting for the people
who morning come in busily
who evenings go out tiredly
degested into systems
of petroeum and steel.</p>

<p>Watching for the people
so buckling steel can masticate
the gentleness of arms and legs
that will no longer feel.</p>

<p>Cars in the parking lot do not sleep
patient in their hunger they watch all afternoon.</p>
