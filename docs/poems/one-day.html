  <div class="poem-body"><p>One day like another all go by
never a thought that some day he might die.
Might–what does that mean–might?
Of course he will, but it is worth a  fight,
in’ it?  Say it is. Keep up the show.
Don’t let grandchildren see, oh…
do they already know
that sooner or later can mean soon not late.</p>

<p>Something ticking in there sets a date.
So, clocking along each minute seems to mock
what should go on, and on. Tick, tock.</p>

<p>But each day matters, makes a difference
when hands go up, eyes bright,
              exchange of sense.
Somehow communication still takes place,
light in the voice.  Someone remember the face.</p>
