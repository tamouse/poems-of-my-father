<p>Geese on the church lawn, what a change.
Time was they were so scarce, lived all alone
On forest lakes. One lake would have one pair,
Who chased off ducks and other geese.
		Now, look,
They crowd on sidewalks, eat;
		they stand and stare
Like turkeys (tame ones).  As they study us</p>

<p>On Sunday mornings, do they challenge us?
We hurry in through doors that do not change,
From week to week, from age to age: the stare
Of saints and cherubim, who keep a lone
And silent vigil, that kind patient look.
They say those birds, on bonding, make a pair</p>

<p>For life, and loss of one must leave despair
Behind: complex, the lesson there for us,
Deserving of a wise and second look.
How can we cause within ourselves a change
In our long habits. We can’t live alone,
Too many though, we soon breathe our last air.</p>

<p>That goose, a broken wing.  The children stare
With sorrow, watch the other of that pair
Stay with its mate who can’t be left alone.
Forbidden flight; what is in this for us?
For surely inborn thoughts allow a change.
The children wonder, tearful as they look.</p>

<p>Now, time to vee up, that sky has a look
Of winter in it, no time left to stare.
The geese sense colder weather, move to change.
The broken-wing one,  gone; loss we compare
To funeral.  The whole flock leaving us
Their honks great primal words we hear alone.</p>

<p>We feel the richer, left behind alone,
A temporary leaving, desert look;
Church maintenance concern enough for us.
One morning, one by one, the children stare
With, See! Surprise! Here comes
		the crippled pair.
They waddle toward our help, our care,
		our change.</p>

<p>A task for us, to feed,  keep warm.  A pair
Of orphans come to stare. A sorry look,
These birds alone may help us to our change.</p>
