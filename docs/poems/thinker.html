<p>Damn
the  piteous
here,
not in Hell
yet
part of it.
The man,
frame
for the mind,
the body,
bone and blood:
machine cold,
blind,
which thoughts
like flames
unquenchable
compel
into the garden
no one
could foretell.
To find
a faulted
mattered
undefined
and undefinable
universe behind
this stage,
where people
clambered down
or fell;
quarreling on one event
absurd
unknowable,
chasing
after a fashion
debating
to abstract
what might be
the first
yes
as well
the last
word;
too late
to wonder
if
the world
meant
to lose
these values
of the lives
it spent.</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>When
will the flames
stop licking.</p>

<p>Each
of my rooms
is warm
on the wall.</p>

<p>The blistering paint
of my table
falls
in flecks
on the floor.
Little tongues
are flicking.
I dare not open any doors.</p>

<p>Through the frame
on my window
the Flowers
watch
eye to my eye;
the Niobe
counting hours
of my garden,
no longer –
my Danish maiden –
cries
to the sky-touching towers
of the city
as flames
from the edge
of my paper
upreaching and roaring
devour.</p>

<p>iii</p>

<p>In San Francisco’s
velvet red
and bronze
east and west
re-echoing
back rooms,</p>

<p>grey shadows
play
on smoke
the wine
exhumes.</p>

<p>In hotel
indoor plantings
green with fronds</p>

<p>half hiding
metal cranes
in fountained
ponds</p>

<p>together cloak
crowd music
reaching blooms
that all the city –
harbored park –
assumes
a permanent
‘perhaps’
for vagabonds.</p>

<p>Man
gripping
delicate and crude
is purpose
error
joke
or interlude,
tasting
nourish
or choke
on sweet or sour,</p>

<p>developing
each century
an hour.</p>

<p>Garden to garden
travels
all the while
losing substance,
hoping yet
for style</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>hammering
hammering
a box
least
of common shelters
as against
a glow
I shut my eyes
to watch
my own blood flow.
Here  learn
that as awarenesses
increased,
we’re blessed
alone
by that which we have blessed.</p>

<p>No one
to help
or hold for us
the cup,
at least
we must
do our own
growing up.</p>

<p>Fallen
piteous
where we failed
that test.
Dark,
the feel of dark,
the smell,
cold ash.
The spent-match odor
one by one
gone
cold
the body still
no movement
none;</p>

<p>no breath, no touch,
no tiny flash,
all done.</p>

<p>Small,
no space,
no light,
no heat,
then
to flame;
hot,  hot,
pain, pain,
each nerve end
slash.</p>
