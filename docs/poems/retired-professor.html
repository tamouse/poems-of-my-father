  <div class="poem-body"><p>And still they gazed and still the wonder
That one small head could carry all he knew	Oliver Goldsmith</p>

<p>The time for line recitals came and he–
Within the context of discussions, talk,
Would quote at length–by couplet, word, or phrase–
Bring in related episodes or thoughts–
An innuendo somehow might connect
To longer passages; poetic moods
Or feelings were as likely as ideas
To string one poem to another, warm
Emotions always overflowing; love
Of line and liner, work as well as worker,
Nobly cited, blessing from the blessed
Upon the meek, the poor, the laborers;
With culminations of compacted joy.</p>

<p>As ever were his thoughts to gladness turned
To ride the waves of love’s sad happy times:
A dividend – through hard years – he had earned</p>
