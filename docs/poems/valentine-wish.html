  <div class="poem-title">Valentine Wish</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>The morning after, here’s a valentine.
Shall I stamp it playfully in snow;
to see it lost in winter’s next mean blow?
I want a more endeared, enduring sign
so I may scribble it across the wall.
But then next cleaning day we lose it all.
Or proudly publish it in someone’s book,
a great report where anyone might look.
Perhaps I’d chisel it upon the street
Outrageous, public, permanent, concrete;
or  rather lost in pockets one that  goes
where you go, shows up like a fine
reminder of one time, a simple line
not thrown away. Let it be one of those.</p>
