  <div class="poem-body"><p>under those sweet rags
one with narrative legs
who has vomited stars
crossing and crossing
the lanes to safe homesteads
breaking the bars
of the polite avenne
hear your friends have scurried
with words in the corners
of their eyes under lights which burn tears
they do not end with counting
themselves each other
give back what is no longer in them
to see again the harvest
in the green blade tremble
teach the three-month
pregnancy of foodstuff
love the hollow in them
their stomach and their soul
unfed they neither drown nor swim
in the currents of their commerce
nor sleep on the mattresses
of fruitful bearing
nor stop in their dreams
until all nights are one
they say what fire dare not say
then die with having been
the voice of all.</p>
