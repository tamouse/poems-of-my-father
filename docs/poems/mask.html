  <div class="poem-body"><p>because the kid without a mask was told
perhaps in earnest more likely though in jest
the problems all seem smaller when you’re old</p>

<p>at any rate his honest heart was sold
he was not of a mind to try a test
because the kid without a mask was told</p>

<p>if one can wait most aches and pains enfold
no more than time can slowly put to rest
the problems all seem smaller when you’re old</p>

<p>therefore forbearing years have gently rolled
still waiting for the time that is the best
because the kid without a mask was told</p>

<p>be patient and just wait be not too bold
behave meet life as an invited guest
the problems all seem smaller when you’re old</p>

<p>but explanations now do not unfold
not much can he of time or strength invest
because the kid without a mask was told
the problems all seem smaller when you’re old</p>
