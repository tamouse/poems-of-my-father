  <div class="poem-body"><p>In London  a museum, tourists in the hall
where marble men and horses
		march along each wall.
The flesh forms echo hills of Greece
		their ancient source
I’m not sure which one suffers more
		the man or horse.
I hear the clank, I smell the dust, I feel alone;
here where what’s most alive is carved in stone.
My own campaigns have been preparing fields
		for seeding.
A boy with a boy’s horse
		that often did the leading.
So strong though near his end;
                        we have him for that reason,
reliable good natured safe. In one cold season
his final walk to pasture fails, his only fall.
I hear my father working in the barn. I call
Pa, the  horse is down Pa, something’s wrong.
Here, take this five-tined fork inside
		now go along
I take the fork but stay? You’ll watch?
              	Pa, I don’t know.
I watch. The giant legs write arcs on
 				sleigh-packed snow.
A crow calls once, I point the fork,
		mock rifle, at the tree.
The black one waits. He thinks I clown,
		or does not  see.</p>

<p>I javelin the fork as he disdains reply.
Tines twang on ice, the crow waits still.
		The metal  cries.
It hurts to die, Pa? Well, he dreams
		he logs old trails.
Or brings in loads of hay, Pa?
                     Sunshine in the bales.
Or like a colt again, Pa?
                     Prancing in new light.
Reliving  all those years, Pa?
                    Now, that may be right.
The death of this old horse
		can surely have no wrong.
Long seasons he has worked to die
		where he belongs.
He is not hurried off to battle there to wonder
at fading light new pain
		and feeling man-made thunder,
red bubbles in the nose, hard breathing,
		belly spilling,
unloved yet naked to obedience and willing,
like boys eighteen who although dressed
		to soldier far
must question, turning cold alone,
		where is the star.
His feet aren’t moving, Pa. We bury him?
Well, no, that only makes the failing processes
 		go slow.</p>

<p>We’ll skid him like a log to brush
		where  he’ll be laid.
Perhaps we’ll stumble on clean bones
		in August shade.
Come home to supper.  It’s all easier
		when you’re old.
Come home, come home.
Don’t just stand there, boy.
                       It’s cold.</p>
