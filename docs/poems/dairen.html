  <div class="poem-body"><p>Keats looked at a Grecian urn
and thought about the figures on it
–human figures doing a lovely thing–
Michelangelo has the same sort of moment
painted on a ceiling
only it is man and God
doing a lovely thing–
both have a moment of
portent turned into everlastingness–</p>

<p>so if I paint even a thought or a wisp
of color on a page</p>

<p>I will be thinking
of all other paintings
putting my painting
in a line of succession
that the Cloudy Curator
will catalog
because that is his job</p>

<p>and for a moment
find Himself
grateful
or not</p>
