  <div class="poem-body"><p>incredible that son of his could be so tall
now needing a pair of dress trousers
good enough for the formal dance
more incredible that this creature
of stream and brushland
was letting himself be fitted
into such civilized apparel</p>

<p>How does it happen, this child
could put on adult disguise
be so debonair
bouncing between heaven and earth</p>
