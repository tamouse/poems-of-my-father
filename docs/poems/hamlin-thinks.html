  <div class="poem-body"><p>Hamlin thinks
of walking on the mountain</p>

<p>a hike is good
an exercise worthwhile</p>

<p>on many levels
find what flowers hide</p>

<p>among old rocks
changing elevation</p>

<p>comes with new varietlies</p>

<p>from his eastward window he can see
sunshine on the mountains It is a puzzle</p>

<p>light shapes here and dark tones
side by side</p>
