  <div class="poem-body"><p>Every time we drove that road
it got shorter
which was very important to us
in that horse and buggy
locomotion
with the horse accustomed
to the speed of a plow.</p>

<p>since then
with all the walking
and driving
we do
I have recently noticed
that all roads
all paths
reduce themselves
with each use…</p>

<p>but there are those times to reset
so discouraging</p>
