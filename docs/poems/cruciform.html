  <div class="poem-body"><p>So many were with vague or sure intent
discovering America, those wise
lost priests, and Portuguese in fishing guise,
Vikings…but not until Columbus sent
back Spanish Isabel word where he went
did Europe open its astonished eyes.
So end of life from flood or plague was prize
man lived with, but the Bomb new terror meant:</p>

<p>This world is ours, ours to destroy, our loss.
So each one must be savior: this leaves
no choice at all, must drag a bark-rough cross
to die abandoned pegged between two thieves;
in that last surge of life, remember moss
for water’s taste with each stab he receives.</p>
