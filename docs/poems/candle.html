  <div class="poem-body"><p>Have you seen my candle?
Yes, it’s part of the exhibit.
I don’t want to tell you
how many hours…
what do you think…</p>

<p>Really?
You have a good eye.</p>

<p>Um, Ma’am…
my candle.
That one.
I’d be embarrassed
to admit
how many hours…</p>

<p>Oriental influence, you think?
Concentricity
with justaposition
in the petrolocity of wax…</p>

<p>All that,
in my candle</p>

<p>I honor your opinion, madam.</p>

<p>So I went home
I tried again</p>

<p>No empathy, you said.</p>

<p>So…  years.
But, now,
a final form
avoiding flaw</p>

<p>but you find a new direction
I could not have known</p>

<p>I will bring it in again
Time and again</p>

<p>Since i have found myself
to be a candlemaker</p>

<p>what else
have I
to do</p>
