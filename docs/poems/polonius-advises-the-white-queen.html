  <div class="poem-body"><p>When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Your friends will think it’s poetry, you know.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.</p>

<p>A cherché word is a linguistic crime.
Use normal speech, with touches of argot.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.</p>

<p>Bring friends who quote you, say “That sounds
sublime.”
Bring your own booklet, everywhere you go.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.</p>

<p>If, by chance, you can’t think of the right word</p>

<p>Fast  enough, don’t let the tension climb;
               hum a little, mumble something low.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.</p>

<p>If “at home” won’t fit, try “chez moi,” “zu Heim”
Or “en casa,” whatever seems more
		“comme il faut.”
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.</p>

<p>Never let a line end awkwardly,  I’m
Sure you will agree.  Keep proper stress also.
When you speak, be sure you speak in rhyme.
Use meter, too; that fools them all the time.</p>
