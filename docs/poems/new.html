  <div class="poem-body"><p>Now is the time for something new,
we have enough of what is old,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.</p>

<p>All digital and not coucou,
not magic woods with bridges trolled,
now is the time for something new.</p>

<p>A drink of marvelous fresh brew
Effervescently kept cold,
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.</p>

<p>Not tapestries now turning blue,
pages yellowed that canâ€™t fold,
now is the time for something new.</p>

<p>Who cares what Aristotle knew?
What do latest studies hold?
razzle dazzle and frou-frou.</p>

<p>Modernity must now eschew
what has faded, smells of mold,
now is the time for something new.
Razzle dazzle and frou-frou.</p>
