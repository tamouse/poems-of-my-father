  <div class="poem-title">Biking Backwards</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>The paperboy rides backwards on his bike. <br />
Discreetly kindly neighbors play their part <br />
and watch through curtains in this world of tact. <br />
The trick is to pretend there is no trick.</p>

<p>Introspective, retrospective, slick, <br />
the skills confusing simple front and back. <br />
The art is to pretend there is no art <br />
whatever form of craft or skill we pick.</p>

<p>The paperboy will visit at our place <br />
to talk a little of what news he brings. <br />
He pedals off, the smile upon his face <br />
toward me, as if I were at home a king.</p>

<p>Heâ€™s riding backwards, turns to look ahead, <br />
uncommon skill to see what will have led.</p>
