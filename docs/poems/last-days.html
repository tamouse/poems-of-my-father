  <div class="poem-body"><p>in that strange
circumstance
we did not know
was coming
where are the sign posts
those shouting billboards
of wise or wise intended
but not wisely</p>

<p>hold my hand
for we must be
together
through this tunneled nighttime
we have wanted
not to end
as we had wanted
never to begin</p>

<p>it did begin
in spite of our desires
in spite of all
we thought that we had done
to keep it all all right
and it will end
end soon</p>
