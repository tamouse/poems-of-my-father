  <div class="poem-body"><p>The spruce root curled
around the edge of a cliff
where the water fell  fifty feet
the least tip of a least root
– Parenthesis. She took her pen
writing how she felt,
water, sound, power,
lace of spray,
persistence  of the flower
stuck to the same rock edge.
The bird too close to her,
she sat so still except for the pen
– end parenthesis –
and split the rock.</p>
