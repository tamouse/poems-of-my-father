  <div class="poem-body"><p>No room for one more photograph; these walls
are full. no frame can hold a picture quite so small
that it would fit within the space between
one image or another. All these rooms
are taken and the house will have no more.
I must go on to find outside a place
to nail my thoughts or give creation up.</p>

<p>The galleries are ready for  a younger voice
the ticket buyers ask which ones are new</p>

<p>The faces that look at me /wink and/ laugh
these faces I had loved and now I half
remember or some not at all</p>

<p>The walls have no more room
for painted images or photographs
the years have been too good
remembrances that leave out
grief and sad encounters
edge each other for attention</p>
