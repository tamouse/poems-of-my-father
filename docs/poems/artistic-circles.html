  <div class="poem-body"><p>He painted gray, <br />
dark gray and light, <br />
enjoyed the play <br />
of day and night <br />
through black to white. <br />
He liked the way <br />
the line of sight <br />
refused to stay <br />
in place; a flight <br />
of sheer delight. <br />
 <br />
He found a clay <br />
he thought he might <br />
by adding, lay <br />
down surprise, slight <br />
but somehow right, <br />
a touch of red <br />
the fighting shade <br />
seemed to have bled <br />
a darker grade <br />
to life and stayed. <br />
	He added blue <br />
almost afraid <br />
as something true <br />
seemed to persuade <br />
the dark to fade. <br />
A middle green <br />
 <br />
a value new <br />
an earthy sheen <br />
enriched  and grew <br />
past what he knew. <br />
He painted more <br />
than he could plan <br />
beyond the store <br />
of well-taught man. <br />
The color ran, <br />
a million hues, <br />
no limit here, <br />
no need to choose. <br />
The whole true sphere <br />
could now appear. <br />
It is too much, <br />
a self-declared <br />
fantastic touch <br />
of godhead glared <br />
past what he dared. <br />
An emptiness <br />
with no control <br />
may best express <br />
the human soul <br />
in its long role, <br />
yet choose one must <br />
and borders make. <br />
He did not trust, <br />
indeed called fake. <br />
the steps we take. <br />
All his work blended, <br />
what can one say, <br />
his efforts ended <br />
as tray by tray <br />
he painted grey. <br /></p>
