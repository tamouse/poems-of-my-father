  <div class="poem-body"><p>When David McDee read the news on TV
There never was murder or stealth
Just birthdays and weddings (new recipes, too)
And people inheriting wealth.</p>

<p>How Mrs. McDee’s flower bed came along,
How neighbors had torn down the fence.
Such positive bits of informative news
To David, made imminent sense.</p>

<p>Soon arsonists found they were fresh out of work;
Oil profits had lost half their fun;
What’s the use in sensation if nobody knows,
If the news won’t include what is done.</p>

<p>When David McDee read the news on TV,
The weather was sunshine and warm.
The sports casts concerned only games
		that were won;
All losses considered bad form.</p>

<p>When David McDee read the news on TV
Pure innocence lighted our eyes
There were no surprises or odd little wrongs:
All greetings and never goodbyes</p>
