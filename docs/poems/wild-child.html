  <div class="poem-body"><p>We found by chance your hiding place,
We saw the bright light of your skin
Scared, dirty face.;
Saw through your eyes,
Within,
That what had left you savage, kept you wise.</p>

<p>We couldn’t leave you well alone
For what kind care or tenderness
Could you have known?
You scratched and bit,
A mess.
We held you in my coat, you had a fit.</p>

<p>We taught, retaught, you passed no test,
Although you were no common boy;
You had expressed
With silent mouth
The joy
That rapt you when the wind was from the south.</p>

<p>Or, when the moon had grown to full,
You drank that light as it were fire
Your strength could pull
From cold night air.
Inspired,
I stood and watched the moonlight in your hair.</p>

<p>One night, next to the window, barred,
You stood between the curtains, drawn.
The sky, ill-starred;
I heard you sing
What dawn
Might sing: you listened to uncommon things</p>

<p>You gathered darkness in your arms,
Your movements quick and light as birds
With forest charms
To judge us by:
No words,
Voiced images in language we can’t cry.</p>

<p>Nothing of success, we let you wait
The wearing years out, out of view.
Ward of the state,
You broke your cage
And flew
At thirty-three – odd number, mystic age.</p>
