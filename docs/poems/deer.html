  <div class="poem-body"><p>When we saw her limping across the meadow,
White tail high, we knew then
		that she was wounded,
Halting as she stumbled, fell down, unflagging
Probably dying</p>

<p>Shoot her, shoot her, that was the thought we
 		shared then.
Hunters all, we knew where to center, focus:
Kill her kindly, quickly; then saw together
Fawn at the field edge</p>

<p>Watching, silent, taught not to bleat or whimper,
Yet a hunger held it. Now who had hunted
Here  (These fields, these woods
were our fatherâ€™s homestead)
Hurting our nature.</p>

<p>When she reached the trees
		for the young one nursing
Even as, while kneeling, she gave her life out,
We could only watch, we could take no action:
Mercy a poor word.</p>
