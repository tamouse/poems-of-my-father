  <div class="poem-body"><p>Upon retirement</p>

<p>To my last students, with so much to live,
Not too much baggage would I have you carry
Through fifty years, but one help would I give–
Not too exact, (who sees the future clearly?)–</p>

<p>A word or two–and surely not my own–
Experience from someone not returning
With sense enough that through each year has grown
In wonderment to value  what he’s learning.</p>

<p>By word or painting, any form of art,
Dear student, take on statements found imbedded
In what you see and hear, that sound from heart
and mind and help confirm which way  you’re headed.
That touchstone to strong life will ring with right
And as you travel, pick up rings of light.</p>
