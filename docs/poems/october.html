  <div class="poem-body"><p>October
hardly a lea
till green
summer denied
by comlement
the great geese
harvet and fat season
across the grove
the rockpile seen again
behind the brush
surprising
the reds and purles
of so many idle sticks.</p>

<p>Over all this color and re-color
the cluds have snow in them</p>

<p>The best eating
is a fist-sized chunk
ripped early morning
from the frost-split cabbage
in the fawn-shared acres
of October</p>
