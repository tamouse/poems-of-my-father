  <div class="poem-body"><p>We keep the light on hoping his return
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.
a simple opening, our lives so torn
the slamming door, soft voice, “Hi, folks, I’m back.”</p>

<p>He was a child we knew could well attract
the troublesome attention, hard to learn
that innocence can meet such dread impact.
we keep the light on, hoping his return</p>

<p>will bring the joyful peace so hard to earn.
His father seems to have his life intact:
few know it is pretense.  His real concern
will be a sudden life-renewing fact.</p>

<p>Too many years already, odds are stacked
against the missing boy.  They tried to warn
us all, that we, in truth, should not expect
a simple opening, our lives so torn,</p>

<p>his mother goes to meetings, her eyes burn
with tears–are all the suspects tracked?
Her project is a stronger way to mourn;
she knows she will not hear:  “Hi, folks, I’m back.”</p>
