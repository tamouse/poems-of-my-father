  <div class="poem-title">Name</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Did you call my name?
I thought I heard you call my name.</p>

<p>No, I didn’t call your name.</p>

<p>I distinctly heard your voice call my name</p>

<p>What else did you hear?</p>

<p>Nothing else, just that and just once.</p>

<p>Strange.  Did you see me, too?</p>

<p>No, just heard your voice.</p>

<p>Where did you think I was?</p>

<p>In the next room.</p>

<p>I was. If you see me and I am not there,
that will be serious.</p>

<p>Hearing is not serious?</p>

<p>Do you think it is?</p>

<p>No, I can just forget it.</p>

<p>Shall I mark it in the calendar?</p>

<p>If you want to.</p>

<p>We don’t want you to go on hearing
what is not spoken.  That’s hallucination.</p>

<p>What a dreadful word.</p>

<p>Isn’t that right?  Hallucination.</p>

<p>What does it mean, where does it come from?</p>

<p>It means you think you hear me call
but I haven’t.  Have you heard others?</p>

<p>No, just that.</p>

<p>What if you were to hear a car horn?</p>

<p>That’s not so bad, so long as I don’t
drive into the ditch to get out of the way.</p>

<p>Or a scream?</p>

<p>And I run to help someone who isn’t there.</p>

<p>What are some words–let’s make a
list of words you don’t want to hear.</p>

<p>“Come here” would interrupt what I am doing.</p>

<p>Were you doing anything just now
when I called your name?
I mean when you thought I called your name?</p>

<p>I wonder, what it is–
the difference between
memory and imagination, and
in between hallucination.</p>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>Can I imagine a sound I’ve never heard?</p>

<p>If it’s a word, yes.</p>

<p>Putting together sounds in ways I haven’t heard?</p>

<p>I’m lost.</p>

<p>Can I imagine a trumpet if I’ve never heard a trumpet?</p>

<p>Not exactly.</p>

<p>Can I imagine a voice singing, a voice I’ve never heard?</p>

<p>A song yes, the words,  but not a new sound.</p>

<p>How does one create a new tune?</p>

<p>What a weird thought</p>

<p>Or a painting, that is not a memory.</p>

<p>Oh, you just splash it around and
decide what to keep.</p>

<p>Suppose I imagine a painting
of something I have never seen?</p>

<p>Can you do that?</p>

<p>Some people can.</p>

<p>No, I think they have paintbrush
accidents, happy ones,
they like what happens.</p>

<p>Do people sometimes talk that way?</p>

<p>That’s crazy.</p>

<p>So, it scares me. What if
I am going crazy?  How do
I know if I am crazy or not?</p>

<p>What difference does it make?</p>

<p>Will anyone understand me?</p>

<p>I’m here.</p>

<p>What if I talk about things
or people that aren’t there?</p>

<p>Not here, you mean.</p>

<p>What if I imagine a fifth primary color.</p>

<p>There are three.</p>

<p>No, there are four.</p>

<p>Oh, dear, would you like a bowl
of that soup I made?</p>

<p>You made soup?</p>

<p>You had some, just had some for lunch.</p>

<p>I don’t remember.</p>
