  <div class="poem-body"><p>he had built a pond
within his garden
where shaded leaves float
dappled on the stream
and as he built a bridge
across the inlet the pond
became the center of a dream</p>

<p>again he builds rebuilds
the pond with willows
he often builds the bridge
that arches there the willows
reach to touch the water surface
colors ghost and mingle in the air</p>

<p>he has given of his garden
all the sunlight worshipping
the long rays
he has lost
to find himself
reborn to flowers
to water
new forces
only painting
will exhaust</p>

<p>again again
he builds
rebuilds
his garden
a clarity
like madness
he possessed
again again
he builds
rebuilds
the garden
the vision
of a blindness
haunts his rest</p>

<p>from reds
through oranges
to yellows
many years
of orange-red
have passed
he has discovered
some permission
in his garden
to paint
the lights and colors
that come last</p>

<p>the morning
gives
one set of mists
of shadows
high noon
another fashion
toys the eye
evening reflections
add
are added
varieties
of visions
will not die</p>

<p>from reds
he has ascended
into yellows
with vision of a blindness
he builds light
until the higher calling
cooler
colors
the violets
are versions
of delight</p>
