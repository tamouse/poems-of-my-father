  <div class="poem-body"><p>What may I bring you
      of a greater worth
Than stranded weeds
     from unclaimed plots of earth.
They are the promise
     first love could express:
First woman in my life
    who gave me life said yes
To these in a most charming way.</p>

<p>What may I bring you
     you could treasure more
If these were once
    what could not pleasure more.
Let common days like common blooms
    find us as plain in heart; hum-drum,
As ordinary
    as a new dayâ€™s start; come
What may.</p>
