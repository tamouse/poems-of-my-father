  <div class="poem-body"><p>my home computer isn’t working</p>

<p>oh it’s working
it has some wires crossed</p>

<p>no, the wires are where they belong
but you see</p>

<p>I see,
that’s a crosstalk problem
why we’ve had that
ever since the second telephone
was invented
you might say</p>

<p>you can fix it?</p>

<p>you need a crosstalk insulator</p>

<p>you have one?</p>

<p>oh not in stock</p>

<p>You can order one?</p>

<p>Let me check the catalog
I don’t see
Oh, here
Only thirty-seven fifty</p>

<p>that will be great</p>

<p>they don’t have them now
maybe when they re-tool
in the fall</p>

<p>then you cannot produce?</p>

<p>don’t get huffy
what’s the use</p>

<p>I  understand
but still
my lemonade
will be one quarter
melon juice</p>

<p><strong>II</strong></p>

<p>why don’t you buy a new one
then you wouldn’t be forever
patching, wiring, screwing
things together</p>

<p>there aren’t any more
I can’t afford it
the new ones can’t be repaired
I’d be so poor  from buying new ones
every year a new one</p>

<p>everyone else has a new one</p>

<p>they are so poor from buying new ones
they can’t go home at night
I can still go home at night
to eat a lemon
or a melon
I’m not sure which
the home computer
has some wires crossed</p>

<p>you still should buy a new one
or not come around here any more</p>

<p>they’re out of new ones</p>

<p>they picked up your old one
someone took it home
to make a lamp out of it</p>

<p>then I’ll go home
to eat a lemon
or a melon</p>
