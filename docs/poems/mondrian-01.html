  <div class="poem-body"><p>where has he gone for so long
a new worm colony
a juicier fruit</p>

<p>so long</p>

<p>so he is not coming back
and me alone
with the nest of little ones
fly around all day
pick up
for the family
keep myself going
besides</p>

<p>I might as well fly off
be done with it
one of us at least
would make
a season of it</p>

<p>he was a good provider
faithful
sharp hunter
strong flyer
always a saucy flare
a lot of beak
his way</p>
