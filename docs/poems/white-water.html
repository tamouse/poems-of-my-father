  <div class="poem-body"><p>A Namakagon runaway canoe
racked up on rocks. A boy, then twelve years old
a boyscout, did no more than he was told
(Kid, get that paddle?) stepped in churning blue
– the speaker teasing had not thought he’d do
the act – the boy was swept off
		thrown and rolled
came home with such a story to unfold:
words phrased as torrents
		he had tumbled through</p>

<p>He could not tell enough – a brownish grey
and metal-flavored memory would stay
to bruise – years on – a normal afternoon –
seen not unlike a distant half-heard tune
not recognizable but flowing still
as sung by his own ghost against his will.</p>
