  <div class="poem-body"><p>The songs they’d hear
with boding-words
to make the ear
list heavenwards
acknowledging
the beauty of
the solacing
of work of love
with words
they’d know to hear</p>

<p>I him salute
whose roughened hand
and whose face mute
the wind withstand
the blushing cheek
yet weatherworn
the mute
the wind-red hand
(I have no plans
to build a spire
that’s not this man’s
task or desire)
No spire I  build
that is not done
my hope is stilled
(approach the sun?)
no plans]
and no desire.</p>

<p>Or if the vine
that I do plant
be in design
so elegant
that painters gaze
guitarists strum
and critics praise
the vine
that I do plant</p>

<p>then I shall say
it simply grew
I’d no mind pay
I little knew
the vine alone
did take the  shape
at beauty grown
those travelers gape
I say
I little knew</p>

<p>How much I’d like
to be just that
some happy strike
all fortunate
so natural
a shape to find
a form to call
but not to mind
just that
is what I’d like</p>
