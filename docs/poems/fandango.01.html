  <div class="poem-body"><p>Say then how can I fly like an eagle
and become quite at home in the clouds
I’d like to be soaring  it never was boring
to be greatly admired by crowds
Oh you never can fly like an eagle
or become quite at home in the clouds</p>

<p>We have shown how to peal a potato
how dumb neckties really are
we wonder what next thing will find you perplexed.
You really keep going too far.
Oh, one additional favor I’m asking:
Is this how to shine like a star?</p>

<p>Is this how to dance the  fandango
with knees almost bumping the heart
magnified leaps almost dangerous sweeps
oh I feel I am coming apart
this is not how to dance the fandango
it’s not hard if you know how to start</p>

<p>So is this how to dance the  fandango
with feather and cymbals and drums
I find this intriguing although so fatiguing
I just let myself flop as it comes
This is not how to dance the fandango
you will crash if you happen to sneeze.</p>
