  <div class="poem-title">Kicking</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Kicking a can, inexpert but cocksure,
he clears the way his Rapid Flyer needs
to coast him down again his neighbor’s hill.
Again, again, adventures clash and rattle
down from chariot to rocket, scars of battle
to a Band-Aide knee.
               With thirst he needs some shade
where little sister sells her red Kool-Ade.</p>

<p>A few years later weapons far more real
more real as well the danger if he bleeds.
“Dear Mommy, may I go out now and kill?”
Not even someone kindly dialing nine
one one, just, “medic, can we help to heal
this one? He’s worth the time? Have we a cure?”
“No, too far gone.  Just morphine will be fine.”</p>
