  <div class="poem-body"><p>I visited the house of Luther Burbank
who must have been forever irksome
to whoever it is
Who has the appointment to creating
new species</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Burbank would be
disappointed no doubt
to hear that people nowadays
no longer have to plant hundreds
of seeds
and select
by some magically intuitive
process which ones to allow
to mature…</p>

<p>they just fiddle around with
the inside of a cell
the slush of life
and wrinkle out all those pesky
eyes of a potato
making it much smoother
for the peeler
who doesn’t know
he now has potatoes
he can not plant a piece of
to grow new potatoes</p>
