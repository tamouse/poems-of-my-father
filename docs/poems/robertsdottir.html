  <div class="poem-body"><p>I’d like to go back to the good old days
when we were together two friends
but nothing so delicate ever stays
ephemeral means it soon ends</p>

<p>those days were friendly and sporty
those days were happy and fine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>we went fishing but there was no nibble
our bobbers just floated around
but we found no reason to quibble
we examined a rock we had found</p>

<p>and a butterfly wing and a dorty
then back to the cabin to dine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>we built a campfire for cooking
but couldn’t find very much wood
so there we were I somehow looking
so stupid right there where I stood</p>
