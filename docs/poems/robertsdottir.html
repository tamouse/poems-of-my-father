  <div class="poem-body"><p>I’d like to go back to the good old days
when we were together two friends
but nothing so delicate ever stays
ephemeral means it soon ends</p>

<p>those days were friendly and sporty
those days were happy and fine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>we went fishing but there was no nibble
our bobbers just floated around
but we found no reason to quibble
we examined a rock we had found</p>

<p>and a butterfly wing and a dorty
then back to the cabin to dine
when I was a young lad of forty
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>we built a campfire for cooking
but couldn’t find very much wood
so there we were I somehow looking
so stupid right there where I stood</p>

<p>but you said, “oh what does it matter
we’ll go buy a bundle of pine”
when I was but forty and fatter
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>you needed more tail on your spring kite
and I couldn’t find any string
the whole project just wouldn’t go right
so instead you decided to sing</p>

<p>well I didn’t know how to fly it
but the sun continued to shine
I was forty and needed to diet
and you were a lady of nine</p>

<p>you skinned your knee it was bleeding
but you wouldn’t shed any tears
just a band-aid was all you were needing
and help with the bicycle gears</p>

<p>I came with a small pair of pliers
a band-aid and no iodine
I was forty and good with spare tires
and you were a lady of nine
             1985</p>
