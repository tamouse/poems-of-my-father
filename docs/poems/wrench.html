  <div class="poem-body"><p>Gees, Mister, you didn’t take much time
to fix the car.
How long, would you say?
The mechanic thought about the years of schooling
and a childhood around garages.
His tools, the hoist, the smells of oil,
little cuts that never quite bled
and never quite healed,
and black, always the black lines on him.
“How long?  Oh, about two arms and a wrench.”</p>
