  <div class="poem-title">Angels, Too: Sapphic Quatrains</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Wonderful!. Alive on this hubbub planet!
Sacrilege to waste even single moments.
Yet I do, in idleness, fiddle, lazy,
Waiting for nothing.</p>

<p>Spirit knocking? Genie to ask my blessing?
Me? To bless a spirit? The wrong direction!
Oh, I beg you! Not for mere man to orderâ€“
Angels bless humans.</p>

<p>Hell, you say, has rules that are true and perfect.
Satan keeps accounts on the clientel here.
Checking off each day the transgressions, errors,
Adding and adding.</p>

<p>Rules, you say, are Hell on the mind and spirit.
God intended day to be New, Rewakened.
Humans, therefore, can turn to blessing angels,
Changing relations.</p>
