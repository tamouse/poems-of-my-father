  <div class="poem-body"><p>A seeker after old things has descended
one hundred thousand years beneath his time.
Long chipping rock to sand-sized pieces
		gives him
one tiny pointing bone he rests. The grime
and sweat have made a mask of mud.
He’s worked all day.
He well deserves a moment’s calm.
Once rock was clay
once clay was flesh. The time reverses:
two are kneeling palm to palm.
The question, yes, the eon-welding  question
between these two explorers must arise,
but how to choose the words
		not spoil the moment
before this crack in time be closed.
		He tries, he tries.</p>

<p>The question long in waiting:
		have they painted yet
the antlered deer to seem alive
and leaping on our wall that magic
will bring food so we survive?
We do survive?</p>
