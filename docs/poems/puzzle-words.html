  <div class="poem-body"><p>A sharp stinging flavor, a cane,
a very large string, a floor of a ship,
the buried lline of a precious metal:
he agonised over the remaining clues
to the Sunday crossword puzzle.
suddenly he stood up as the tart odor
of fresh blueberry pie reached his nose.
He grabbed his walking stick, flung the honors
rope over his shoulder, ignored the solitaire
deck strewed behind him, and began the grand march,
not feeling the weak spot in his blood vessel
give way in the last fatal struggle
of a vein to hold itself together.</p>
