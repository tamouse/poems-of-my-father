<p>he sure the parents are advised: some scenes
may not be suitable. before this birth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.</p>

<p>we very likely will offend some deans.
who knows what unintended flicks are worth?
be sure the parents are advised.  Some scenes</p>

<p>will catch them unprepared: the teens,
for instance; dangerous, although their mirth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.</p>

<p>To wait. to wait, late hours in front of screens
that flicker nonsense of commercial dearth.
Be sure the parents are advised: some scenes</p>

<p>the young adults: child-like in jeans
can have them tossing. An uneasy berth
can overwhelm them with what one life means.</p>

<p>To try to help them suffer the machines
the cluttered lights and shadows of this earth,
be sure the parents are advised: some  scenes
can overwhelm them with what one life means.</p>
