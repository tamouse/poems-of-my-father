<p>ground apple papas kartolfen krumpli;
what would it have
been in latin had they known what
    mystic consideration in antique Pharsee</p>

<p>POTATO 6 (found poem)
one measure of rutabaga
one measure of apple
one measure of potato
mashed together
heaven and earth</p>

<p>potato poem</p>

<p>smooth reaches of white
insides
barely discernable structure</p>

<p>only the eyes are obvious
whether the skin
be light, dark,
proud red
secretly divine russet</p>

<p>only the eyes
spiral on the outer skin
in perfect fibonacci sequence</p>

<p>like the psychological framework
of something growing
in the unaware reaches
of the human mind</p>

<p>POTATO 8</p>

<p>north of Bubba
you have your mashed potato,
baked potato, twiced baked potato, fries, curly friesâ€¦.</p>

<p>POTATO 7</p>

<p>a rifle, three twenty-two longs, salt, a dog,
a friend, two kitchen matches,
two unharvested potatoes neglected in the field,
for a feast in the woods of potato and partridge</p>

<p>POTATO 9</p>

<p>twenty-five-mile wide
lump
shaling debris
in the plummet around the sun</p>
