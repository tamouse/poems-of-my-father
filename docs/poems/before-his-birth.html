  <div class="poem-body"><p>how could she have known that in the days
before his birth the stars converged to grow
a brightness meant to let some shepherds know
what stars were doing: concentrating rays
as but symbolic for a larger phase
of new ideas knotting to let glow–historical significance–to throw
life’s meaning backward with a craze
for taking god so bloody big in ways
that numbed the brain; that thwarted mental flow
–imagined god above and life below.
The separation crosses and betrays
the hope of once discovering the tie;
the one of grass, plain ground with clear blue sky</p>
