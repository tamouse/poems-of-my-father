  <div class="poem-body"><p>
        An old house left alone
Not much cleared land
some city pioneer
		did not imagine
		forty acres
</p>

<p>
  When Hamlin was five
his sisters had a story
to keep him out of that decaying house
</p>

<p>
		The monster, green, invisible,
		but stopped by the gum fence
		that existed only to the monster.
</p>

<p>
  Gum fence?  gigantic chewing gum?
</p>

<p>
  			Later he knew
		the fence was made of resin
			dropped
			from aboriginal pinetrees
			decomposed long ago
		evoked by sisters to protect
</p>

<p>
  Now, how to harvest that old gum:
			so often people need
			that good gum fence
</p>
