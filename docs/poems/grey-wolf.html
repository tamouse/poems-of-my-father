  <div class="poem-title">Grey Wolf</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Does the grey wolf state his purpose in his howl
for his companion: “Here we follow.
Something has gone by here, in the night,
something live and full of substance has gone by.
Together we may find it, make it ours.”</p>

<p>Does the grey wolf know
that one thing, then another
makes a sequence, takes him to an end
that he can plot and carry out,  repeat.</p>
