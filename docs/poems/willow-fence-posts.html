  <div class="poem-body"><p>The farm   I visit now has one old barn
that   I remembered was about to fall,
cave in from age, worn out by time and wind,
when  I last saw it years ago. It stands
now as it had stood then, sway back, a threat
to any neighbor kid who thought to climb
to rotting rafters now too dangerous
for ten-year-old explorers biking free.
The house itself, still lived in, with a fresh
and shiny layer of tarpaper siding
is warmly lit inside by modern means
where once a single kerosene lamp burned:
a midget wick of slight illumination.
  I open my car door to stepâ€¦and then
  I see them, trees that have been growing all
these years, and dying too; a give and take
of life and death. Small branches newly green
rise high and on the ground a tangled death.
The neighbors who had lived here built a fence
with willow posts to hold barbed wire. The posts,
because they were black willow, then made roots
and twigs and so set out to reaffirm
what they might have to do
		with woods and farms.</p>
