  <div class="poem-body"><p>I stand by a bus stop
in my hometown.
On the bus a sign
DRIVEN BY FRED LASHER.
That couldn’t be Fred Lasher,
dead for fifty years.
How could his name be there?</p>

<p>Fred Lasher wouldn’t give his name
    to rules
to time to drive a bus
King Lasher and his round forty</p>

<p>I remember
because he wouldn’t stay
inside the lines
the lines they draw
in Washington DC
to mark his borders
where to plant
where to cut his wood</p>

<p>Fred Lasher
had the sense
to cut the wood
where the wood was
just as he shot his deer
when deer were ready
not like the men who came</p>

<p>to play at hunting
in red hats
one week ten days
those lines drawn too
in Washington DC
to tell a man
where axes chop
when rifles shoot</p>

<p>Then startled
I remember when I am
why that’s Fred Lasher’s
grandson’s used his name
I knew it all along
that couldn’t be
Fred Lasher</p>
