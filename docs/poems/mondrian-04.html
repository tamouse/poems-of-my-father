that what anyone can see through
is so readily forgotten
but one moment
before everything gave way
someone took me
for an entrance</p>

<p>but there is never time
one short glimpse
for gettng ready
crowding crystals
in the right places
to make the design
important
at least noticeable
not to be disappointing</p>
