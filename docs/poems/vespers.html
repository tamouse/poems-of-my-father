  <div class="poem-body"><p>Because we are not part
of the million scrambled children
hutted uphill
from the January river</p>

<p>Because we are not part
of the business built bonfest
who ride out to them
between afternoon closing
and family dinner
to down a few
with bullets well-placed for kindness</p>

<p>We thank you
merciful giver of every good</p>

<p>Because we are not half-dying
from newly discovered diseases
caught when we believed
that love is free</p>

<p>Because we have no need
to care for them
or have to bury them
as we talk about a testimonial
and the value of the yen</p>

<p>Most of all because
OTR means one touch record
and never in all our lives
nor in the lives allowed
to merge with ours can it
ever come to mean
ON THE RUN
We thank you
kind and merciful
GIVER OF EVERY GOOD</p>
