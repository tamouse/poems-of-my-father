  <div class="poem-title">Nathan Flang - The Necessary Persona</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>he wrote
he wrote his name a thousand times
he cut the paper into little squares
NATHAN ESQUIRE FLANG , POET
he walked five blocks from home
and then ten blocks
to find the lawn he needed</p>

<p>he said
hi neighbor
here’s my calling card
working on your lawn I see
I’m interested: how you control your weeds
I like the way you do your dandelions</p>

<p>do you get help with that
two or three bright yellows over here
a sort of cloud of them there</p>

<p>that must have taken lots of thought and time</p>

<p>the neighbor hasn’t anywhere to go
he makes no move
except his trembling  hand
gives  back to Nathan Flang
his calling card</p>
