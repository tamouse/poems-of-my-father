  <div class="poem-body"><p>this is a day the lord has made
filled with a holy faith and grace
into destruction we have strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face</p>

<p>we may well vanish without a trace
this is a day the lord has made
with a shadowed terror we must face
what land did we so swift invade</p>

<p>We’ve in what devil’s thicket strayed
with a shadowed terror we must face
this is a day the lord has made
what demon chose we to embrace</p>

<p>with a shadowed terror we must face
such foolish victims, fools out-played
in burned out times in a desert place
this is a day that the lord has made</p>
