  <div class="poem-body"><p>as if each room of the large school
was  a poem or part of a poem
students are assigned by age
or number of rooms
they have passed through
which is called their grade</p>

<p>where they go to earn a grade
grades pile up to make a school
which they hope to make their way through
sometimes by memorizing a poem
which is also divided into rooms
especially if from a forgotten age</p>

<p>so each year is an age
and each year is a grade
which means so many rooms
the total  of which is school
of which no one writes a poem
not even when they are through</p>

<p>it is a blast, a ball, the way through
watching your own increasing  age
life is a  poem,
for some an uphill grade
they cannot finish school
they get lost in the  rooms</p>
