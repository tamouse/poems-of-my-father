  <div class="poem-body"><p>I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
broad black hat and a polished cane
arranging careful each catch and drape</p>

<p>nothing is more important than an outward shape
a shining buckle and a silver chain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape</p>

<p>A mourning color, heavy voile or crepe
a distant love guitars a heart’s refrain
arranging carefully each catch and drape
I love to watch the grubby neighbors gape
carefully avoiding any smudge or stain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape</p>

<p>all held together by the pins and tape
hooks are extra at the points of strain
arranging carefully each catch and drape</p>

<p>especially flattered when those lessers ape
proud and elegant–just short of vain
I stroll on Sunday in my long black cape
arranging carefully each catch and drape</p>
