  <div class="poem-body"><p>We have imagined toads
so now we need
a garden that is real
with hedging room
for all the claims and clutter
that accumulate
from wasteful non-intended
weâ€™d
be first to grow
to where the worm will feed
whatever doubling myth such words assume
wherever this pathology might lead
into a garden seed
becoming flower
into a mind
whatever mind develops from or grows into
shreds
of conscious here and there
gathered strands
of spooling galaxies
where servants weak but human
teach
a crippled god to walk</p>
