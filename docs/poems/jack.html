  <div class="poem-body"><p>( the poem I wrote
while trying to write
<a href="/poems-of-my-father/poems/alexandrine.html">Alexandrine</a>  )</p>

<p>the tallest horse we ever had was Jack
in thirty years he did his share of pulling
he went to the ground
while I was leading him, a high perched crow
announced alarm. Jack slipped to sleigh-packed snow
I’d heard his heavy breath as we’d come back
his head was dropping, wide eyes dulling.
the crow’s one sound.</p>

<p>he lies there, I go to the stall
I clean it with the fork that has five tines.
I hear his breathing
I angry point a mullein at the tree
in rifle style; the black one does not see
or thinks I clown reutters his one call;
about Jack’s head in frost-drawn lines
a cold cloud wreathing</p>

<p>now other duties call me from the Belgian
filling dumping attic bin and cellar
could he not die
be some forever horse to thrill our race
like those from Marly now on Concord Place
like those that London gained from righ Lord Elgin
like that of him who drew us a propeller
would not tell why</p>

<p>that proud one never metalled from the vision
nor born from burial thirty feet to rise
above the crowd
like in Geneva the Unridden Horse
( of histories that chariot our course )
through corridors of circles or collision
of blues that love the yellow’s red surprise
( If that one be allowed )</p>

<p>at least this faithful horse has not been led
to battle whimpered hurting to the ground
bewildered frightened
betrayed in far off angry man-made thunder
I sit beside the unfamiliar head
the crow informs the world with his one sound
the breath has tightened.</p>

<p>At least this horse has not had that to fear
as naked in obedience yet willing
dutiful if not bold
Like boys, eighteen, who, soldiered far,
must question when alone where is the star?
Horrible to think, as beasts endear;
Red bubbles in the nose the belly spilling
the senses cold…</p>

<p>Jack on his side his unshod feet now writing
gigantic arcs upon the crusted snow
New struggle? Old adventure?
A dream he skids ghost logs on lost woods trails,
or, provident pulls yet as  his strength fails?
breathing almost done, the great eye fighting
the flighted sentinel–well-ended, so,
our mutual indenture.</p>
