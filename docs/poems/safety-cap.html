  <div class="poem-title">Safety Cap</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>The cap so hard to open that the pill
rolled out along the floor, a tattle sound
that said too much, he turned around;
‘What is this clatter, are you really ill?’</p>

<p>She held her stomach, it was only fear
that hurt, but hurt more than she cared to stand.
‘You are not ill, the doctor said the pain
 was nothing but imagination;  here
give me that bottle, put it in my hand.’
She let him take it…
	                             let
	                                the dishes
	                                             drain.</p>

<p>Then she saw on the counter one more pill,
she must have lost it there.  Without a sound
she swallowed it. He did not look around.
The pain was dulled, perhaps she was not ill.</p>
