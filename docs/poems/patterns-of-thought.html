  <div class="poem-body"><p>Patterns of thought
a maple tree
top branches
gone all bare
against a sky
of clear and cloud
in singing air
without a stir
the morning
comes so clean
with something secret
in the scene
the  birdnest
in lower branches
still with leaves
common enough
the sparrow flies
and chirps
and grieves</p>
