  <div class="poem-body"><p>I am Pueblo
of the village
Peopleâ€™s Canyon.
You enter my rooms
where your presence is taboo
You walk where I walk
you do not see me in this wan dusk
You would wrap me in linen
and cure me with spice
I do not appear to you
I live where only my people
can truly live
Where we have sequestered
since the great drought and famine
do not touch me
do not call me
I am Pueblo</p>
