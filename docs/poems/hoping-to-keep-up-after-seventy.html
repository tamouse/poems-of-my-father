  <div class="poem-title">Hoping to Keep Up After Seventy</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>When the morning clouds arise
not as faithful as the sun
but regular enough
will I still have two good eyes
or at least one
so that getting off my duff
I wonâ€™t stumble
hear friends mumble
as I grumble</p>

<p>When friends and birds begin to chatter
after silences of night
as the heavy darkness clears
not that what they say will matter
idle nattering of light
will I still have two good ears
or must I watch the spreading lips
with fear that gossips
lose their grip?</p>

<p>When the tiny leaves of spring
turn the browned-off earth to green
and there is talk
of adventues while we sing
of the beauty to be seen
will I still have legs to walk
or must I only in my mind
such lonely pleasure find
while left behind</p>

<p>When aromatic flowers
brighten landscapes with their color
will I have the heart to follow
or will I have lost such powers
Will I grow dull and duller
life gone hollow
or will my faculties extend
to the end
to have and be a friend</p>
