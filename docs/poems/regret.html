  <div class="poem-body"><p>it wouldn’t have been half bad
the six or seven couples who
wanted to go off with what we had
and live together for a year or two
far apart from all this come and go
to find a mountain where the sun and glow
at sunrise and again come dusk the way
a rising peak can find a longer day
it wouldn’t have been half bad
if we had dared to shuck it all and leave
sometimes I wish I really wish we had
we work jobs when we should go chop or weave
we work away for things that if done right
we’d make a trade-off for our laziness sake
and do not see our lack of sight</p>
