  <div class="poem-title">Blue Bird Guitar</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>the book has fallen
from his hand
as under a November sky
unseasonably warm
an afternoon goes by
on its perch
inside the ornamental crab
a bluejay is alerted
from stops and starts
of brakes too shrill
of the approaching mailman’s cab</p>

<p>the bird flies down
beside the man who has lain so still
the wild bird thinks him safe
double error
lands on the guitar
the strings sound
to the bird’s and man’s surprise
one awakens to where they are
the other wonders what they’ve done</p>

<p>the mail
time to slowly rise return
dear occupant
you have already won</p>

<p>to know who lives here really?
possibility remote
with which he hasn’t time to dwell
the book left in the wind
changes chapters
willy-nilly page by page unread
it’s just as well</p>

<p>he’s almost missed the smallest envelope
no doubt of which loved child it’s from
dear uncle
less involving than the telephone
he’ll return a kindly note
easy to send cash but that’s not done
–leave them on their own
plantings won’t survive too long
 in spring initiation hats
so one career at college is put off
an extra year or two more means
no one sorry glad if anything
the high coursed phase of life
can slow
the nephew needs no debts
so let it go
enjoy the youth’s discovery
of what old age forgets</p>

<p>the ads    the best no comfort
and the least no stress
imported letters to the wrong address
the book the last page turned
has closed itself as if aware
the wind selects leaves
in the garden
working toward the winter’s lying bare</p>

<p>a magazine invites a hope
for a refreshing crumb
short story little captured skit
a cartoon with the hand of love
behind its touch of wit</p>

<p>across the yard the neighbor
has grown children every week
give time to him
well, not to him, but to the house and garden
keeping trim</p>

<p>they have no time to stay ahead of chores
no listening then to how grass or a tree
takes care
the civilizing touch
they help each other to remember
common lie
the way it used to be</p>

<p>when he can’t do his own
he’ll hire the work
nephews if they choose
but limited to short chance visits
delighting in them
he will not abuse
obedience soft eyes bright skin
those past all childhood even
the promised waiting of the boys
the waiting promise of the girls
where time can never win</p>

<p>his wife retrieves
the fretted instrument
the bird returns inside the tree
a skittered leaf stays busy at its task
the dust across the garden swirls
and dances with a question
no one turns to ask.</p>
