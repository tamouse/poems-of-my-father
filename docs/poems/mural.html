  <div class="poem-body"><p>this letter is a mural
runs along the wall
across the window
right on the glass
write on</p>

<p>one long line
now and then
it runs off sidelines
sidebars
shaped  locutions
of nonsense
and misguided sagacity</p>

<p>forgets itself
and runs up
to the ceiling
falls to the floor
trundles along
out the door
up on the wall again
out in the hallway
leading to the elevator</p>

<p>close the door
donâ€™t let it get out
into the lobby downstairs
nothing to stop it with
no way to clean it up</p>

<p>now down the street
correctible conclusions
on the curbs of humanity</p>

<p>who now will overcome
this spread of the letter
that is a mural;
will it discover the mountain</p>

<p>and then the valley</p>

<p>how did it get started
this inexhaustible supply
of ink and words
inside a small brush
to swish and slide
on all the surfaces
of the world</p>
