  <div class="poem-title">After a Reading</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>to work the ground
wear tough leather brogans
with two-buckle rubber overshoes
Soil will leech the leather
so the two layers bought separately
are never taken apart.</p>

<p>The shoe will bear the strength
to break the sod, to break a horse,
to tramp into a swamp
to find a cow
gone off alone for giving birth.
Stop where the cow is licking
pick up the calf
the mother goes on licking
the belly of the calf
the leg of the calf
the arm of the man
who crouches crouches low
so the rasping and caressing tongue
can reach the calf
as they travel up the slope
the pain of crouching
travels up the leg
across the back
along the arm
the mother licking
they bring each other to the barn</p>

<p>Tonight I heard a lady reading
delicate ivory earrings
swinging with her words
quiet proper powdered
authentic that to the degree
I succeeded in listening
she tramped my prairie brushland
pastured swamp
in plow shoes.</p>
