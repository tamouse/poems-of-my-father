  <div class="poem-title">Following Fire</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>After the fires, the tourists came <br />
Hoping the camps would be the same <br />
But the trees were gone.  The bear <br />
And deer moved to higher ground. Everywhere <br />
Were the scars of flame.</p>

<p>We’d lost–we thought–what has been ours– <br />
The great pine groves, the cedar towers <br />
where a million people came each year– <br />
Wiped out–whole mountainsides burned clear. <br />
Then came the flowers.</p>
