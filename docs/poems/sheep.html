  <div class="poem-body"><p>A day together, picnic without crowds.
We find a beach the others would reject
                        For you insist
                        on water. Clouds
                        reflect
the distant pinetrees, self-effaced in mist.</p>

<p>The wash of short-lived suds
		on hard-packed sand;
the great waves rolling, roaring, laugh and speak
                        lines we expect.
                        Here we might stand
                        a week
to watch where crumbled mountains
		lie foam-flecked.</p>

<p>White gull cries, water, rock, air, sand, and sun
on this stretch are no cans or bottles strewed
                        and here we sneak;
                        the shore where none
                        intrude
with reasons for the blush upon your cheek.</p>

<p>You let me find your buttons, ties, and hooks
to let the sun have you–while I stay dressed
                        as you run nude
                        you have with looks
                        impressed
so I am only prudent not a prude.</p>

<p>Beneath some trees, as if set by Manet,
we are a composition “tres superbe”
                        We two at rest
                        “Le déjeuner
                        sur l’herbe”
(which still some dull establishments protest.)</p>

<p>Leaf sounds from bushes, steady, rustling, brisk,
do not add to the sense we are alone.
                        A little scared–
                        because of risk–
                        (our own)
and wondering if what we did, we dared.</p>

<p>Just as you are we run, now brave. We spring
both laughing as our timid smiles we flash
                        forward to known
                        and unknown things.
                        We dash–
the raw earth colors blend with your skin tone.</p>

<p>At least this moment seems both fresh and new.
We pick our careful way through nearby weeds,
                        thistles and burrs.
                        I carry you
                        (good deed)
but not enough control for what occurs.</p>

<p>Earth’s surface rises here to rocks, sharp, sheer.
Some of the weeds are spreading, some have died.
                        We have more need
                        to take care here
                        or hide.
Watch out! I slip, you scrape your knee, it bleeds.</p>

<p>Against a steep rise, difficult rock face,
some pain, much fear your sudden silence tells
                        Ways must be tried
                        from this hard place
                        or else.
For all at once, life’s not all cut and dried.</p>

For all at once, life’s not all cut and dried.</p>

<p>The bleeding slows. I have you on my back.
I study handholds, seeing lichens, granite blocks,
                        some ancient shells,
                        the green, blue, black
                        of rocks,
with spells of balance, balancing of spells.</p>

<p>Not certain, both our body weights combined
of making headway here where rocks are steep
                        bruises and shocks
                        sharp pebbles grind
                        I creep.
A new sound. A lone beast strayed from flocks.</p>

<p>A bleat, a movement, walking cloud of white:
he knows the path. We are no longer stuck.
                        found by a sheep,
                        a welcome sight,
                        This buck
becomes a friend we hope that we can keep.</p>

<p>He scrambles from us, showing us the way.
Easy steps a passage I’d have missed.
                        A fast pace struck,
                        your clothes, new day,
                        The gist:
we have some gods who care for us, or luck.</p>
