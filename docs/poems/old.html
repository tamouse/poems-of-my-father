Let us hope for something old
not this everlasting new
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold</p>

<p>ii
not too much paving where trucks rolled
get rid of bolt and screw
Let us hope for something old</p>

<p>iii
what has been so oft extolled
beauties time has proven true
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold</p>

<p>iv
men on white horses strong and bold
both tough in sinew as in hew
Let us hope for something old</p>

<p>v
stories not too often told
along with forms the ancients drew
like oak trees, glaciers, woven gold</p>

<p>vi
books not bound but scrolled
no acid paper, stained with glue
Let us hope for something old
like oak trees, mountains, woven gold</p>
