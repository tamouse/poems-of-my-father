  <div class="poem-body"><p>imagined worlds
more real than any other
a group child stands beside me
empty-eyed sees nothing</p>

<p>where are those who brought him
something to do on a rainy day
but so careless they have lost him</p>

<p>in the next room
blocks of color wisps of wonder
all this world of warm
to me is cold unmade discovery
as when
I first read poems by Baudelaire
Drooling beside me the group child
has become my brother
mon semblable  mon fr√®re</p>
