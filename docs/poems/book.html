I tried an outline, couldn’t find a thread;
Something to rememeber, lines to quote</p>

<p>I read the whole book, couldn’t take a note
All these words, what is it he has said
There must be something to this book he wrote</p>

<p>The need for meaning gathered in my throat
To find where all his learnèd effort led
Something to remember, lines to quote</p>

<p>His images, not especially vague, remote.
Where precisely have my senses fled?
There must be something to this book he wrote</p>

<p>From all angles no way does it denote
Some light to guide us as most books have shed
Something to remember, lines to quote</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s just his way to stay afloat
As a professor, publish or be dead.
There must be something to this book he wrote
Something to remember, lines to quote</p>
