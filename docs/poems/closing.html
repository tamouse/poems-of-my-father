  <div class="poem-body"><p>The house is closing,
no more show
take down fold up the curtain
wrap the lenses
take apart the dimmer,
other machinery
and paraphernalia
put away the systems
bit by bit</p>

<p>the uncountable chairs
cushions and all
have already gone
to other uses
in other houses</p>

<p>tell the children
to remember happy times</p>

<p>the pauses waiting for response
the lost lines with made up
subsitute lines never spoken again
and no one knew the difference
the grandchildren need not know
cannot know the details
of the putting on
the pain of make-up
the ache of muscles wearing out</p>

<p>but let them know
make sure they know the stories
and for a few
help them to hear
the march of words
across a line.</p>
