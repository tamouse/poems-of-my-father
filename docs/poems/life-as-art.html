  <div class="poem-title">Life as Art</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>to make of life an art
a voyage as by boat
a worthy wave-bashed craft
held together by design
not afraid to enter
to go now slow now fast</p>

<p>as life itself demands â€“ go far
go slow, adjustment is the art
of how to come and go.. to enter
as the powers of design
a bold and built together craft</p>

<p>attempting art.. achieving craft
a slow approach departing fast
get out by knowledgeable design
is art
knowing the waters and the boat
knowing when it is time to enter</p>
