  <div class="poem-title">A Past I Dreamed Was Mine</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>My finger nails have stopped growing.
A serious thing when you are fifteen.
Even dead people grow fingernails,
a detail pepople forget whan they draw ghosts.
I know my fingernails arenot growing
because I broke one off short two weeks ago
		it’s still short.
I made a chart to mark when I cut my nails,
that was ten days ago. I haven’t marked it yet.
Maybe they rest a while, so there’s hope.
I don’t believe that.
Whatever awful thing has happened to me
I am stuck with it.
My fingernails have stopped growing.</p>

<p>I eat,
I still shave once a week.
I do all the other bodily functions.
I still need a lot of sex and don’t get any.
I am not growing fingernails.
I will wait a week more maybe two
then I will have to get help.
Somehow.
I won’t go through my parents,
forget them.
My dad, what a yucky word,
so much like dead.
My Dead sends my Mom money,
the court forces him to.</p>

<p>My mom still thinks she can ground me
Me.
I am fifteen.  She sends me to my room:
does she come by later to check
if I have crawled out the window,
does she care who is making all the noise
when I rattle around in the garage
for fifteen minutes to dig out my bike,
does she look up when I ride past
the front of the house.
She sits there being pretty for her boyfriend.
I bike off.</p>

<p>I take the old country road
around the sewerage
and up to Blandin Hill.
It is gettng dark, but that does not matter
I get every curve and rise
memorized in my body</p>

<p>The hill is a good place to sit,
The cemetery is nearby
so the hill  is lovely
so I think about ghosts.
I wonder if my dad will want go be brought back
to this town when he dies,
if he dies while i am still young.
I could brush dirt off his gravestone.
I am walking now along the back edge
of the cemetery alone,
I should see ghosts.</p>

<p>I wish I was the right kind of person,
not so rotten inside.</p>

<p>My dad’s dad is here,
will dad want to be buried here?
I walk over to the grave.
I don’t need light to do this,
just stars.
The white pine near the grave
is a huge shape in the sky.
I feel the stone.
How long is the grave?
I stretch out,
I am still short.
The grass is covered with dew
The ghost of my grampa should be here.
I slam my fist into the ground.
Mom doesn’t care where I am.
I have to go to the bathroom.
My fingernail hurts.
My shirt is soaked.
I should go on the grave.
Why do I think like that?</p>

<p>I walk back up the hill.
The dark is heavier than usual,
Some clouds have crept over.
I can’t find the bike.
Trash it.  Who wanted to go home.
I go near some bushes.
I can hardly find Grampa’s tree again.</p>

<p>I am not sure it is Grampa’s grave I am on.
The grass is even wetter now.
The clouds are letting go a soft mist,
Water is running on my skin
inside my shirt.
I am too much of a ding-dong
to  have worn a jacket.</p>

<p>The noise of a car
has me scrambling into bushes.
Light is scattered all over from the junk heap.
Some guys with some chicks.
I see light on my bike.
I sneak around and get it.
The road is slicked over by the rain
but I get home.</p>

<p>Mom and her boyfriend
are still taking up a lot of light and space.
I crawl through my window.
I get out of my clothes,
I let the sheets soak the wet off me;
I shiver as I get warm.</p>

<p>I remember watching a horse shiver once,
his whole body working this way and that
inside his skin.</p>

<p>My dad should see how I am shivering.
I have never felt so much inside my own skin.
The sheet is rippling
It is stopping,  I am warm.</p>

<p>I try to keep it going but it doesn’t work
I lie quiet,
like on a grave,
my dad’s grave;
his ghost is asking me about shivering.</p>

<p>Next week I’ll rip down the chart.
By then I’ll just have to be able
to cut my fingernails.</p>
