  <div class="poem-body"><p>I loved the child with roses in her hair <br />
she wove with vine and petals hummed a strain <br />
and danced. The morning wonderfully fair</p>

<p>was warm with her and bright. Beside my chair <br />
she left some clustered blooms. Through unknown  pain <br />
I loved the child with roses in her hair.</p>

<p>A garden princess, could a thorn be there? <br />
A royal presence certain of her reign <br />
who danced the morning wonderfully fair,</p>

<p>exquisitely light with sunbeams everywhere. <br />
That moment was the height I could attain. <br />
I loved the child with roses in her hair.</p>

<p>As on her blushing cheek she charmed the air <br />
with song and twirling a rose chain <br />
she danced the morning wonderfully fair.</p>

<p>I did not know then I could not repair <br />
a missing step that she could not explain. <br />
I loved the child with roses in her hair <br />
who danced the morning wonderfully fair.</p>
