  <div class="poem-body"><p>An act of vandalism was the cutting off
of the head of the Little Mermaid statue
in Copenhagen harbor.  .</p>

<hr />

<p>Silences and waiting times so long
And never knowing was it sea or land
I was to watch.  Still with no words, no song,
The world confused, the world to understand.</p>

<p>Born in a myth by sailors out of place,
Born by a mist, longing, what would they see:
A baby seal, enchanting eyes, loved face;
From image of strong wives this came to be.</p>

<p>When men first told the tale, we could exult:
A hope of innocence set on this coast
In metal form for tourists. The result:
Neglect where grey-white gull wings
		touch the most.</p>

<p>So stories grow or lie on dormant shelves
Until men once again research themselves.</p>

<p>(I dreamed once I could neither see nor hear
But like a wounded beast crawled off to die;
Yet could not die; a legend turned to fear;
A wingless gull that feeds but cannot fly.)</p>

<p>When working men go by on lonesome ways
To face long fishing months,
		they meet these eyes;
They stare, renewing thoughts
		of homebound days
With open sea-trust we both recognize.
When sea-born spirits visit here and dance,
The very surface dances too. Here flocks
Of gathered high-flown birds descend, entránce
The air. They clamor whitely on dark rocks.</p>

<p>Three men by boat – what they were thinking of
Was never wave-born, never myth, nor love.</p>

<p>The head, the sawing off, took half the night.
Pain in this metal state is hard to shape.
A cringing rasp, a grate, in star-cold light;
Decisions out of limits learned from rape.
Lovely the head, reflection sank, dissolved;
Above, whirlpooling oars creaked
		round on round.
Mere vehicles of water merged, revolved;
Seeking the cry, yet sightless, could not sound,</p>

<p>False dawn awoke the wraiths
		who slept off shore.
They trailed among the rocks and reminisced
As mourners, listened, searched,
		but found no  more
Since all was phantom here, sheer mist in mist.
This blew away… so world again… except
Soft  daylight glinted bleeding where it crept</p>
