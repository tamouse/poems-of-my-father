  <div class="poem-body"><p>This is the Diner Kidd.
I work in a little diner
that looks like an old street car.
Long and narrow and yellow
like a cable car without imagination.</p>

<p>I’m the won hoo clozuz at nite because
the otherz R afraid.
I’m a frade too but wot the hey.
What scairs  reelie is the voices I
here.  If I saw as much as  eye here
that wood be a caseof hallucination.
Sounds arnt a nuff.
But I doo here things.
Ecksept when  aye member to wear
my aluminium foil hat.
Then I hear nuthing. Not even all the
uther ppl have left to go home or off
to after concert parties.
