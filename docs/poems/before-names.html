  <div class="poem-title">Before Names</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>once there were  no names
for the earthâ€™s
uncountable things
and acknowledging that only a few things
have acquired names
after all these gifted lives piled on determined lives</p>

<p>before anything was named
powers of magic electrified
sinews and roots</p>

<p>none of this separation into classes
categories species platoons genuses
all was one great surge of feeling</p>

<p>a dark stranger shuffled by with tags
cracks appeared in the fleshberg of creation
words put a difference into existence</p>
