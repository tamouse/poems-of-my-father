  <div class="poem-title">To Sell</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>Must sell the season’s crop, it will not last
the day. Must push the creaking wagon past
who hungers for a word or two and so
the Merchant of Four Seasons calls out, “Buy
my oranges, my lemons, peaches.  Try
 these still lifes now, before they have to go,
before as day goes on the sun rides high.</p>

<p>If harvest food or music be what pays
he chants his lingo, he repeats his phrase
each seventh step.  (He always ends on eight,
like sergeants beating time into recruits).
Who will not buy a peach for twenty cents.</p>
