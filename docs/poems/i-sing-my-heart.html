  <div class="poem-title">I Sing My Heart</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>I sing my heart out in a wilderness
like a victim of some violence
too horrible to tell.  My private fate
that will not let itself be known until
–on this calm afternoon of blind distress–
a final mistic ignorance descends
while those more competent than I await
to sing much louder their soft vesper hymn.
I listen for a shushing antinym.</p>
