  <div class="poem-body"><p>When he looks at the window he sees specks
enduring glass, frame edges that need paint,
collections of a world of dust with stained
reminder of the children who reflect..</p>

<p>Wen he looks in the window, he sees now â€“
The furniture, her things that decorate,
a table top, a stand, the TV screen
They watch together after dinner, how
the years have changed some things, while others wait
While decades pass; a comfortable scene.</p>

<p>When he looks out the window to inspect
the trees he planted, all those that remain
provide them too much shade.  What has gained:
success in life too late now to reject..</p>
