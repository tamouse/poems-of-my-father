  <div class="poem-body"><p>Make poems as closely as you can
a talk someone rewrote.
Let language sing,
not man.
When Yeats was living he had said these things.</p>

<p>The matching of it all is the surprise
with nothing stretched or cropped.
The fall
and rise
of lines must seem but casually dropped.</p>

<p>Yet Yeats did not pursue
the even line the measured phrase.
We should have that, too.
The words in time
with all the care rewriting thoughts entails.</p>

<p>Most of all he showed
how music swells
so fine
from brief and broken modes
like bells
while slower reading rides and lifts
              the longer line</p>
