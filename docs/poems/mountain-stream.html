of glacier            the highest
     soft             reach
         ordinary            of water
        snow         before it gathers
approaches edge                to its currents
           of coldest April            into rivulets
the universal             to streams
moisture                                Pebbles
among mosses                          first leaves.
short-lived flowers                       Spring
          the first spot     is always  somewhere
 deep enough                             on the mountains
to  swallow  water,      an open bedroom green
          taste  the sky        soft decoration
                 the scraggy peaks                bedroom
      would have woven          air is warm
                had they known          as your love
 Shallow pools                       fountains   mine.
     deep                                    A rush to rocks
       enough                                    to meadow
            to hold a sky               larger  flowers
                 where storm clouds               yellow white
        echo                           a touch of red  blood
               clouds repeat    dipped           with bravest
                                           claws
         sparrow
   of circling hawk    floating blossoms</p>

<p>Wonder
as I see you                               would this
continue      you see through me
            to reflect                      whole
stream flowing
if is but pebbles            should close my eyesâ€¦
and the silt                                would you?
and sands that line                    Each look
Stir                                     a variation
the surface                     so know me
ripples play                           in and out
for newer versions                   a light-flecked
this dappled substance                        surface
           can this be                   can this be
               another life     another life
                    as we twisted
                       limb and current
                          now two beings
                       flow as one
                   child of our own love
Each twig of a tree
is a search for the upright
many paths to try
we now play splashing
                   tiny cataract of tears
where may month brambles scratch and creep
     play laughing exclamation
         look   I found one wet white stone
                                  perhaps an opal we
will keep</p>
