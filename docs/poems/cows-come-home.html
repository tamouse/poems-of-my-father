  <div class="poem-body"><p>the shoe is stained
the jacket torn
the fingers aging into statue</p>

<p>a church tune
nasals in his head
having lost crescendo droning</p>

<p>he beats his hands together
stammering a pitiful condition
begging: cuppa cuppa</p>

<p>unless one listens back
thirty years to hear the lost crescendo
he claps his hands to drive the dog</p>

<p>cuppa cuppa .. cuh baw  cuh baw
“come boss, come boss”
in words as old as languages
old beyond all parthenons</p>
