<em>Carlos Drummond de Andrade</em></p>

<p>The bones are pieces of a broken chair.
The skin is heavy cotton, wool for hair.
Buttons, of course, clever threads, a face.
Four walking cans. Ears; floppy pillowcase.</p>

<p>A rolled up trunk, eager to hold, to lift.
Real tusks. That lasting liquid eye, a gift.
On each side, glued-on flowers
and small clouds.</p>

<p>No one looks or smiles in all the crowds
He ambles through; so, tired past love tonight,
Each piece he will fold neatly, wrap just right.</p>

<p>For now, he strides, he sways.
He owns the street.
The tail almost drops off, cloth drags, his feet
Scrape.  The too-thin chair parts
creak and bend.
He is all grace; hoping to find a sad friend.</p>
