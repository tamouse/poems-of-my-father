  <div class="poem-body"><p>The friend has made no visit
for eight weeks
Has feigned a loss of sense
in what he speaks.</p>

<p>The world will listen first
then execute
Must he by that acclaim
afraid fall mute?</p>

<p>I loiter where he wrote
that hardest line
Iâ€™d have him back to taste
a useful wine.</p>
