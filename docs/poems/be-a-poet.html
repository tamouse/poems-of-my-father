  <div class="poem-body"><p>Who put it into him  to be a poet,
someone stuck in a dime that he’s so wordy?
Must he jabber, must he drone, that hurdy-gurdy.
Who put it into him to be a poet?</p>

<p>Just say it once that’s all it needs.
He’s not a novice telling beads.
Who  put it into him to be a poet?</p>

<p>Why does he want to write it down?
He’ll never really get to town.
Who put it into him to be a poet?</p>

<p>All those singers, actors, dancers,
they don’t think they have the answers.
Who put it into him to be a poet?</p>
