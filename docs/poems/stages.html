  <div class="poem-body"><p>Imagine stepping through one door
and then another each one leads
to one more grandiose room
until you reach a single place so large
that you are lost
so lost you cannot stay there, not return</p>

<p>so many forces work preventing your return
no way to find the door
definitely lost
Path and hedge-side nothng  leads
awayâ€“forever to remain at large
what  blessing that the whole world is your room</p>

<p>at last you find your way into a room
one season smaller now you can return
to find again what seems no longer large
follow footsteps anything door afer door
to rooms with gardens one step leads
into a space to  keep you..unlost.</p>
