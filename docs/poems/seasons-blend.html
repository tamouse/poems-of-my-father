  <div class="poem-title">Seasons Blend</div>
  <div class="poem-body"><p>We ski on rhododendron petals spray
a snow of pink blue green as season blends
with season, overlay of days on day;
New Zealand Alps, Swiss Eucalyptus, trends
our dreams take, memories a cluttered drawer
disordered needing albums all about
a cubist near-clarity restore
sense with the photographs that you take out</p>

<p>what year it was this happened
        when was that
not nearly so important
as that now
what is adventurous
we may find new
and old at once
only a change of hat
or scarf to move
into what times allow
us: happy days
that we do and re-do</p>
