  <div class="poem-body"><p>A oalace of rocks, a drink-deep moat
Of mountainâ€™s glacier splashes cold,
Twisted among the struggled trees.</p>

<p>Cold helps the ardent man devote
His tme andstrength, as he grows old,
Tot asks best done each day on knees.</p>

<p>The sound of swirling wind off snow,
Adrift with darkened clouds, has told
How rough the weathering day will go.</p>
