<p>Robert Lyle Temple, aka Bob, oldbob, pa, dad, Uncle Bob, popka, Grampa
Bob, The Professor, passed on March 23rd, 2018. Heâ€™s much missed and
much loved.</p>

<p>My dad was a poet, and produced some really amazing work, which is
here. I wanted to make something as a tribute, and to let others know
about his writing.</p>
